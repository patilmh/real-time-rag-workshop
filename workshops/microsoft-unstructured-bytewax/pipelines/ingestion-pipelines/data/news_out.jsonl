This marks the lowest level since April 2023 and the fourth consecutive week of rate declines, according to the <strong>Mortgage Bankers Association</strong> (MBA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/real-estate/24/08/40629862/where-billionaires-are-snapping-up-homes-in-2024-hint-no-fear-of-climate-disasters\">Where Billionaires Are Snapping Up Homes In 2024 \u2014 Hint, No Fear Of Climate Disasters</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As observed in recent weeks, despite lower rates, purchase applications have not moved much,&#8221; said <strong>Joel Kan</strong>, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Prospective homebuyers are staying patient now that rates are moving lower and for-sale inventory has started to increase.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortgage applications saw a modest increase of 0.5% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) Weekly Applications Survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refinancing activity showed a slight decline. The Refinance Index fell by 0.1% from the prior week, though it remains 85% higher than the same week last year, reflecting a robust annual surge in homeowners looking to take advantage of the lower rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) also saw a decrease in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 5/1 ARMs fell to 5.98% from 6.25%, indicating some relief for borrowers seeking more flexible loan terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing home sales increased for the first time in five months as falling mortgage rates have convinced prospective buyers to take out loans. However, sales are still slow as homeowners with mortgage rates around 3% wait for rates to fall even further, according to the <strong>National Association of Home Builders </strong>(NAHB).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Total existing-home sales rose 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95 million in July. This marks the first increase after four months of declines. On a year-over-year basis, sales were still 2.5% lower than a year ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Despite these changes, sales remained sluggish and low inventory continued to push up median home prices,&#8221; the NAHB said on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeowners with lower mortgage rates have opted to stay put, avoiding trading existing mortgages for new ones with higher rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This &#8220;lock-in&#8221; trend is causing home prices to rise and holding back inventory, but this trend should reverse as mortgage rates keep declining, the NAHB said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Mortgage rates are expected to continue to decrease gradually, leading to increased demand (and unlocking more of the lock-in inventory) in the coming quarters,&#8221; it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Mortgage companies moved modestly on Wall Street into Thursday&#8217;s mid-afternoon trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>UWM Holdings Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UWMC#NYSE\">UWMC</a>) declined 0.93% to $9.07</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rocket Companies, Inc. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RKT#NYSE\">RKT</a>), parent company of  <strong>Rocket Mortgage</strong>, fell 1.79% to $19.21</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bank of America Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BAC#NYSE\">BAC</a>) went up 0.45% to $40.13</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Home builders also moved little on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>D.R.

Okta&#8217;s guidance for its current remaining performance obligation (cRPO) growth in the fiscal third quarter also fell short, predicting a 9% year-over-year increase, compared to the 13% growth seen in the fiscal second quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40624915/this-okta-analyst-turns-bearish-here-are-top-5-downgrades-for-thursday\">Analysts reactions to the report</a> were mixed. While some maintained a positive stance, such as WestPark Capital, which reiterated a Buy rating and a $140 price target, others lowered their price targets and expressed concerns over the company&#8217;s growth trajectory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, B of A Securities downgraded Okta from Buy to Underperform, significantly reducing the price target from $135 to $75, citing the slowing momentum and weaker guidance as key reasons for the downgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several analysts, including those from BMO Capital, Scotiabank and Stifel, acknowledged Okta&#8217;s robust execution and some positive aspects like strong enterprise deal flows and larger contract sizes. However, they also noted challenges such as sluggish new customer acquisition and persistent uncertainty around seat growth and upsells, particularly affecting Okta&#8217;s Workforce Identity and Customer Identity segments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Else: </strong>Despite some encouraging results and optimism from certain analysts, the overall sentiment remains cautious.

These evidence-based therapies help individuals safely confront their trauma-related memories and learn that these memories and associated cues no longer pose a threat. PE typically involves weekly sessions over three months, while MPE is condensed into 10 daily sessions over two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Study Details And Participant Enrollment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this novel study, the MPE protocol will be enhanced by adding an MDMA-assisted therapy session on the second day. The hypothesis is that MDMA will facilitate emotional processing by reducing distress, potentially improving participants&#8217; ability to confront and process traumatic memories. &#8220;It is hypothesized that MDMA will allow participants to approach these memories with less distress. Our goal is to explore if these two therapies will be synergistic in helping participants emotionally process the traumatic memories,&#8221; said Dr. Rothbaum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Betty Aldworth</strong>, MAPS director of communications &amp; post-prohibition strategy, emphasized the significance of this research: &#8220;This grant demonstrates MAPS' continued commitment to advancing research to improve our understanding of the utility and delivery of psychedelic-assisted therapies as potential treatment options. Assessing the ability of psychedelics to enhance evidence-based treatments like PE and MPE, which have a large base of trained providers, allows MAPS to both fund novel research and support greater potential access to psychedelic-assisted evidence-based therapies.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enrollment for the study is open to 15-40 participants, including both civilians and veterans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cover image made with AI</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-29T20:03:20Z", "headline": "Multidisciplinary Association For Psychedelic Studies Funds MDMA-Assisted Therapy Trial For PTSD", "id": 40637513, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/29/2-15.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/29/2-15.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/29/2-15.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "MAPS funds a $200K pilot study at Emory University exploring the synergy between MDMA-assisted therapy and Massed Exposure Therapy for PTSD.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-29T20:03:21Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40637513/multidisciplinary-association-for-psychedelic-studies-funds-mdma-assisted-therapy-trial-for-ptsd"}

{"author": "Piero Cingari", "content": "<p>Fitch Ratings reaffirmed the U.S. sovereign credit rating at &#8216;AA+&#8217; with a stable outlook Thursday, citing strengths like high per capita income and the financial flexibility afforded <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/fitch-ratings\">by the U.S. dollar</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rating agency also flagged growing concerns over escalating debt and increasing political polarization. According to Fitch, this heightens the nation&#8217;s vulnerability to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/macro-economic-events\">economic and confidence shocks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;government has failed to meaningfully tackle large fiscal deficits, the growing debt burden and looming increases in spending associated with an aging population,&#8221; the Fitch report said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, the U.S. standards of governance fall short of the average levels seen in similarly rated country peers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, as of August 2024, Fitch Ratings assigned an AA+ rating to Austria, Canada, and Taiwan as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Governance Shortcomings, Fiscal Woes Persist, Fitch Says </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last August, Fitch downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from AAA citing &#8220;a steady deterioration in standards of governance,&#8221; leading to a high and growing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/08/33523662/fitch-slashes-us-credit-rating-5-top-economists-weigh-in-on-economic-fallout\">general government debt burden.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, in that occasion, the agency had also predicted that tighter credit conditions, declining business investment, and a slowdown in consumption would have led to a mild recession in the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 a forecast that turned out to be entirely off the mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitch expects the current precarious fiscal position to remain largely unsolved, despite the contrasting economic goals, tax policies, and spending priorities of presidential candidates Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> and former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We expect most of the 2017 tax cuts will be extended under either Trump or Harris,&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cuts represent about 1.2% of GDP and are expected to exacerbate the fiscal position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While revenue-enhancing measures such as Trump&#8217;s proposed trade tariffs or Harris&#8217; plan to raise corporate taxes are on the table, Fitch believes their impact will be neutralized by other policy measures, including the extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or the implementation of child tax credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Economic Deceleration Looms, Debt Projections Worsen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. economic growth is projected to decelerate, with Fitch estimating an average growth rate of 2.1% in 2024, down from 2.5% in 2023. The slowdown is partly attributed to reduced government spending. For 2025-2026, growth is anticipated to average 1.6% as economic imbalances gradually correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2024, Fitch forecasts a slight narrowing of the deficit to 8.1% of GDP, driven by modest revenue gains and a reduction in discretionary spending. However, the interest burden is expected to rise due to higher debt levels and increasing interest rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given our expectation that fiscal policy will not change much under the new administration, we expect 7.7% of GDP deficits in both 2025-2026.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The debt ceiling suspension is anticipated to last until the end of 2024, after which the debt threshold will be reinstated. As in previous years, the government may rely on extraordinary measures and cash reserves to delay reaching the critical x-date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We expect Congress to pass continuing resolutions to extend the FY2025 appropriations bills due Sept. 30, 2024 until after the elections and possibly through March 2025.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitch projects that the government debt-to-GDP ratio will climb to 124.4% by the end of 2026, significantly above the median for AA-rated nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/29154132/image-306-1024x508.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-521636\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/29154132/image-306-1024x508.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/29154132/image-306-300x149.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/29154132/image-306-768x381.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/29154132/image-306-1536x762.png 1536w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/29154132/image-306.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Despite the rising debt level, the financing flexibility of federal government benefits tremendously from the role of the U.S. dollar in the share of global reserves and the most important currency in trade, borrowing and in global payments,&#8221; Fitch wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding monetary policy, Fitch expects the Federal Reserve to initiate a rate cut cycle, with a 25 basis point reduction likely in September 2024, followed by an additional 125 basis points in cuts throughout 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Reactions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar remained broadly unchanged following the Fitch Ratings&#8217; report. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), tracked by the <strong>Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UUP#NYSE\">UUP</a>), was 0.3% higher at 3:30 p.m. ET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treasury yields were up by about 3 basis points across the curve, slightly rising during the session amid a stronger-than-predicted economic growth in the second quarter.

ASML stock ultimately ended the session slightly negative at $887.71. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The government of <strong>Dick Schoof</strong>, who came into power in The Netherlands in July, will apparently not renew ASML's licenses to repair and maintain their products in China. This includes providing spare parts as well as having ASML employees stationed at Chinese companies, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/the-netherlands-to-put-more-curbs-on-asml-s-china-chip-business?srnd=homepage-europe&amp;sref=TBDibEcD\">Bloomberg</a> reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Semiconductor production lines are extremely complex and require fixed personnel to provide maintenance service. ASML has 10,000 customer support employees on staff, including service engineers and applications specialists, some of whom are permanently placed at foreign manufacturing companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Chinese companies have not been able to purchase extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from ASML. The new rule would involve the servicing of ASML's deep ultraviolet lithography, which are second-in-line in the company's product roster and are held by Chinese tech companies like <strong>Huawei</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest EUV machine from ASML runs about $380 million, and the company <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/38842448/taiwan-semi-flags-high-costs-of-asmls-latest-chip-machines\">has sold it to </a><strong>Taiwan</strong> <strong>Semiconductor Mfg.

The Biden administration has released a battery of measures aimed at hampering China's growth in the sector and boosting the U.S. domestic industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moves have been framed within the context of national security, as semiconductors are key parts in advanced military equipment and in the development of high-end artificial intelligence, among other applications that could influence the geopolitical power balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/22/10/29273679/chinas-semiconductor-industry-decapitated-overnight-what-annihilation-looks-like-1\">Biden threatened to revoke citizen privileges to U.S. persons</a> working with Chinese semiconductor companies, causing an exodus of American tech workers from the Asian nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just last month, the government enacted an executive order <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/08/33683351/biden-targets-chinas-semiconductors-and-ai-with-new-order-restricting-investments\">restricting U.S. investment in Chinese high-tech sectors</a> including semiconductors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moves are in line with other measures aimed at boosting the American domestic chip industry, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/07/39592660/biden-administration-pumps-504m-to-boost-ai-chip-innovation-in-tech-hubs\">including tax breaks and billion-dollar funding packages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the Biden administration issued a new rule expanding U.S. powers to bar tech exports into China from countries such as Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/07/40078235/biden-rule-on-semiconductor-exports-to-china-is-huge-positive-for-chip-sector-suppl\">when U.S. technology is involved</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. used this rule to influence Schoof's upcoming decision, Bloomberg reported, as the Biden administration pushes to steer its allies against Chinese technological growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spokesperson from China's Ministry of Commerce said this week that <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40546725/china-slams-us-for-including-chinese-firms-in-export-control-list-undermines-the-international-trade\">U.S. actions undermine \"international trade order and rules\"</a> and disrupt the \"security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/asia/24/05/38800273/chinas-semiconductor-spending-tops-us-with-142b-commitment-global-chip-race-heats-up\">has invested more than the U.S.</a> in boosting its domestic semiconductor industry, the country still lags behind in developing its own technology to become independent from foreign suppliers, many of whom are based in countries that align with U.S. political interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The largest semiconductor ETFs can be affected by geopolitical moves.

Quarterly sales came in at $2.552 billion, missing the consensus estimate by 2.52%.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Comparable sales decreased 1.2%, driven by a 1.8% decrease in transactions and a 0.6% increase in average ticket. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Merchandise inventories, net at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 10.1% to $2 billion. The increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brand launches, the opening of the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, and the addition of 49 net new stores since July 29, 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While we are encouraged by many positive indicators across our business, our second quarter performance did not meet our expectations, driven primarily by a decline in comparable store sales. We are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store performance, and we have actions underway to address the trends,&#8221; said <strong>Dave Kimbell</strong>, CEO of Ulta Beauty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are focused on driving stronger sales and traffic and continuing to exercise financial discipline.

Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 3.01 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>MasTec Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1724964310_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for MasTec has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing MasTec's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure.

This strong boost in GDP, alongside recent jobless claims that showed no significant cooling in the labor market, has caused traders to slightly scale back their expectations of a larger rate cut from the Federal Reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Traders Start To Question Need For Large Rate Cuts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The market-implied probability of a 50-basis-point rate cut has now fallen to 32%, down from 38% the previous day, according to the <strong>CME Group</strong>&#8216;s FedWatch tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, the likelihood of a smaller 25-basis-point cut has risen to 68%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further ahead to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 7, there is an even split in the market&#8217;s expectations between a 25-basis-point and a 50-basis-point rate cut that month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, market participants are pricing in a total of 87 basis points in rate cuts by the end of the year, suggesting at least three consecutive 25-basis-point reductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8216;A Roaring 2020s Kind Of Day&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Today was a Roaring 2020s kind of day,&#8221; said <strong>Ed Yardeni</strong>, president of Yardeni Research.

{"author": "Franca Quarneti", "content": "<p>Denver's latest licensing bulletin reveals a sharp decline in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/colorado-cannabis\">marijuana-related revenue.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the report, the city generated $48.1 million from marijuana taxes and licensing fees in 2023, a significant drop from the $72.6 million peak in 2021. This decrease is indicative of a broader downturn facing the legal cannabis industry, exacerbated by oversupply and regulatory pressures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39848320/denver-veteran-cannabis-city-speaks-out-on-rescheduling-we-have-a-lot-of-expertise-to-offer\">Denver: Veteran Cannabis City Speaks Out On Rescheduling, &#8216;We Have A Lot Of Expertise To Offer&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The allocation of this revenue reflects Denver&#8217;s strategic use of cannabis funds to address critical social issues. In 2023, $7.95 million was directed towards services for the homeless, $7.53 million was allocated for affordable housing and $3.32 million supported youth education programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impact On Crime Rates And Industry Survival</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kdvr.com/denver-guide/denver-report-finds-marijuana-legalization-did-not-impact-crime/\">As per</a> FOX31, <strong>Mason Tvert</strong>, a prominent industry spokesperson and leader in marijuana legalization efforts, said: \"It is a very difficult time for the legal cannabis industry.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tvert also pointed to the necessity of finding solutions to excessive supply and urging support for the industry. \"They want to pay taxes and they want to be regulated and treated like other businesses, but they cannot survive if we continue to overtax and overregulate.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also touches on the shifting landscape of marijuana-related crime in Denver. Marijuana-related crime constituted a mere 0.2% of total crime in 2023, a figure that the Denver Excise and Licenses spokesperson <strong>Eric Escudero</strong> pointed out as evidence of the city's effective regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We successfully prevented that prediction that crime would skyrocket,\" Escudero said, attributing the success to Denver's pioneering regulatory framework, which has been emulated by cities nationwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the <strong>Denver Police Department</strong> has reallocated its marijuana task force to address the rising fentanyl crisis, signaling a shift in focus as marijuana-related issues decline in priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DPD Lt. Ryan Harris noted, in dialogue with FOX31: \"You see the reduction in marijuana seizures over the last decade, so I don't think this is a surprising number. This was where these numbers were trending towards.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also indicates a significant drop in the number of medical marijuana dispensaries over the past eight years.

This offense carries a harsher penalty, such as a fine of several thousand euros, up to two years in prison and a driving ban of at least three to fifteen years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Polish police check the THC levels carefully and regularly. Ewa Murmyllo, the press spokeswoman of the police in S\u0142ubice said, &#8220;If we detect a positive result from a quick drug test, the driver will be taken to a hospital. There, they must undergo a detailed blood test that precisely indicates the amount of substances consumed. We then classify the offense accordingly based on the results.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40564933/berlin-grants-first-cannabis-cultivation-permission-lower-saxony-to-introduce-fines-with-hefty-p\">Berlin Grants First Cannabis Cultivation Permission, Lower Saxony To Introduce Fines With &#8216;Hefty Penalties&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Philippines: House Rep.

However, NHS prescriptions are restricted to specific conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to NICE guidelines, the NHS requires licensed cannabis products to undergo rigorous clinical trials before they can be prescribed, limiting availability of these treatments. Only three licensed cannabis products are available through the NHS, making it difficult for many patients to obtain them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Get Benzinga's exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

If you're serious about the business, you can't afford to miss out.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Growth And Illicit Trade Concerns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK&#8217;s medical cannabis market is on a rapid upward trajectory, with projections indicating that patient numbers could surpass 300,000 by 2028, up from the current estimate of around 50,000. This expansion, driven by increasing acceptance and private sector involvement, could result in substantial market opportunities for investors. However, it also presents significant challenges, particularly concerning the illicit trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key players in the European cannabis market, Curaleaf (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CURLF#OTC\">CURLF</a>) is leveraging its strategic expansion in the UK to out price the illegal <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39442869/2-9b-european-cannabis-market-a-strategic-blueprint-for-cross-border-transportation-logistics\">cannabis trade</a>. According to <strong>Juan Martinez</strong>, head of <strong>Curaleaf International</strong>, the UK market has massive potential.\u00a0Over 2 million British adults are believed to be self-medicating with cannabis, yet only 45,000 are registered MMJ patients. This discrepancy is evidence of an untapped market that could grow significantly if regulatory frameworks and public awareness improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/uk-cannabis\"> the UK</a>, Curaleaf has introduced vapes and gummies, gathering data from over 30,000 patients to tailor their products to medical needs. This approach allows the company to present compelling evidence to regulators, which is crucial in a market where the NHS offers limited access to cannabis-based treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these advancements, the rapid growth of the legal market may inadvertently be fueling the illicit trade. The National Crime Agency (NCA) reported that illegal cannabis seizures at <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40604161/whats-behind-increased-cannabis-seizures-at-u-k-airports-supply-demand-and-naive-smugglers\">UK airports have tripled </a>in under a year, with organized criminal gangs exploiting demand by smuggling cannabis into the UK and selling it at a premium.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Martinez <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39256203/curaleaf-international-is-beating-illicit-cannabis-prices-in-uk-and-germany-whats-next-for-eu-ex\">notes </a>that in the UK, pharmaceutical-grade cannabis through legal channels is priced at \u00a35.50 per gram, compared to \u00a310-15 on the illicit market, making it an attractive option for informed patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39256203/curaleaf-international-is-beating-illicit-cannabis-prices-in-uk-and-germany-whats-next-for-eu-ex\">Curaleaf International Is Beating Illicit Cannabis Prices In UK And Germany &#8211; What&#8217;s Next For EU Expansion?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Need For Further Research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department for Health and Social Care emphasizes the need for more research to give NHS doctors confidence in prescribing cannabis-based medicines. While the NHS funds licensed products, the lack of evidence for unlicensed ones remains a major barrier. As the market grows, there is a rising demand for comprehensive trials and regulatory engagement to expand NHS access to these treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40604161/whats-behind-increased-cannabis-seizures-at-u-k-airports-supply-demand-and-naive-smugglers\">What&#8217;s Behind Increased Cannabis Seizures At U.K. Airports?

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>Former Obama administration economic adviser <strong>Betsey Stevenson </strong>criticized Republican vice presidential nominee<strong> J.D. Vance</strong> on Thursday for spreading misinformation about the effects of tariffs on consumer prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Stevenson, who served on 44th U.S.&nbsp;President <strong>Barack Obama</strong>&#8216;s Council of Economic Advisers and as chief economist at the Department of Labor, took to social media to rebuke Vance&#8217;s claims that tariffs on Chinese goods led to lower prices for Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The frustrating point about Vance&#8217;s lie is that policymakers need to know the true effects of policy and make decisions based on facts and preferences,&#8221; Stevenson <a href=\"https://x.com/BetseyStevenson/status/1829178057799967110\">wrote</a> on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University of Michigan economist&#8217;s comments came in response to a video clip of Vance stating, &#8220;Our corrupt leadership said if you put tariffs on China, prices will go up. Instead, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did that, manufacturing came back and prices went down for American citizens.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stevenson cited former White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair<strong> Jared Bernstein</strong>&#8216;s explanation of tariff economics, emphasizing the importance of understanding their actual impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As @econjared46 honestly acknowledges tariffs raise prices to shift consumption toward domestic producers,&#8221; Stevenson noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernstein had earlier clarified the purpose of tariffs, stating, &#8220;The point of such tariffs is to raise the price of imports so consumers will buy domestic products. If they don&#8217;t change relative prices, they don&#8217;t &#8216;work.'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40596411/nasdaq-s-p-500-futures-flatline-as-traders-await-earnings-report-from-ai-barometer-nvidia-fund-mana?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wall Street On Wait-and-Watch Mode Ahead Of Nvidia Earnings</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The criticism from Stevenson comes amid a series of controversial statements and actions by Vance. Recently, Vance appeared on NBC&#8217;s \"Meet the Press\" to defend former <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/08/40628997/jd-vance-rejects-claim-that-trumps-tariffs-would-be-a-tax-on-americans-disagrees-tariffs-cost-am\">President Trump&#8217;s tariff policies</a>, arguing against claims that these tariffs amounted to a heavy tax on American consumers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vance rejected the notion that tariffs cost Americans nearly $80 billion in new taxes, asserting that the real targets were foreign importers who <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/08/40628997/jd-vance-rejects-claim-that-trumps-tariffs-would-be-a-tax-on-americans-disagrees-tariffs-cost-am\">rely on cheap labor</a> to undercut U.S. workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Vance has been vocal about his opposition to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40591746/jd-vance-lashes-out-at-kamala-harris-for-allowing-chinese-battery-plant-in-michigan-she-wants-to-pay\">establishment of a Chinese battery plant</a> in Michigan, attributing the decision to Democratic policies and Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>. He linked this to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Harris supported, accusing her of enabling Chinese companies to access clean-energy companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the controversy, Vance recently made headlines with a bold claim that owning a new car costs every American $50,000 a year, blaming Vice President Harris for the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/08/40482592/jd-vance-shocks-with-claim-that-owning-a-new-car-costs-every-american-50-000-a-year\">increase in costs</a>.

The growth was driven solely by consumables like food, rather than discretionary items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40568347/after-binance-and-coinbase-gary-gensler-led-sec-set-to-lock-horns-with-crypto-exchange-kra?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">After Binance And Coinbase, Gary Gensler-Led SEC Set To Lock Horns With Crypto Exchange Kraken</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shares of Dollar General plummeted over 30% following the earnings release. Net sales rose by 4.2% year-over-year to $10.2 billion, while operating profit fell 20.6% to $550 million, partly due to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40623595/dollar-general-q2-earnings-earnings-miss-slashed-outlook-and-shrinking-margins\">markdowns and inventory losses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, competitors <strong>Walmart</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WMT#NYSE\">WMT</a>) and <strong>Target</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TGT#NYSE\">TGT</a>) reported strong sales growth in their <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40486532/whats-happening-with-walmart-stock-following-targets-strong-q2-results\">latest quarters</a>. <strong>Dollar Tree</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DLTR#NASDAQ\">DLTR</a>), another rival, is set to report earnings next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The earnings miss by Dollar General underscores a broader trend of cautious consumer spending amid persistent inflation. Even household names like <strong>J M Smucker Co.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SJM#NYSE\">SJM</a>) have warned of reduced consumer spending, affecting <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40634810/inflation-is-eating-into-sales-of-companies-across-the-board-even-this-household-food-name\">sales across various sectors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, economic data has shown a mixed outlook. <strong>UBS Global Wealth Management </strong>recently increased the probability of a U.S. recession to 25%, citing softening job growth and unsettling unemployment data. Despite this, the firm still anticipates a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40574036/ubs-raises-us-recession-probability-to-25-amid-cloudy-economic-outlook\">soft landing for the economy</a>, driven by consumer spending, albeit with a &#8220;cloudy&#8221; economic outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, traders have scaled back their bets on a significant rate cut by the Federal Reserve, following an upward revision of U.S. GDP growth in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/large-cap/24/08/40639345/traders-scale-back-bets-on-50-basis-point-september-rate-cut-ahead-of-fridays-key-fed-inflation-ga\">the second quarter</a>. This adjustment comes as the market eagerly awaits the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial jobless claims totaled 231,000 for the week ending Aug. 24, down from the upwardly revised 233,000 the previous week and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/08/40624663/us-economy-expands-by-3-in-q2-surpasses-earlier-estimates-jobless-claims-little-moved-last-week\">slightly below the expected 232,000</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action</strong>: Dollar General&#8217;s stock closed at $84.03 on Thursday, down 32.15% for the day.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p><strong>Intel Corp.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\">INTC</a>) CEO <strong>Pat Gelsinger</strong> acknowledged investor concerns following a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40633329/us-stocks-rally-dow-jones-achieves-record-highs-as-gdp-outperforms-nvidia-falls-whats-driv\">significant drop in the company&#8217;s stock price</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Gelsinger said the company is working diligently to address these concerns. He made these remarks during a fireside chat at Deutsche Bank&#8217;s technology conference in Dana Point, California, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/intel-intc-gelsinger-skepticism-activist-layoffs.html\">reported</a> on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We respect some of the skepticism we've received from the market,\" Gelsinger said. \"We believe we're up for the challenge.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel&#8217;s stock plummeted 26% after a disappointing quarterly earnings report earlier this month, marking its worst day on Wall Street in over 50 years. The stock is down over 57% this year, trading near its lowest in more than a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gelsinger noted that Intel is facing challenges in its server business due to artificial intelligence-driven weaknesses but remains optimistic about the future. He highlighted the upcoming launch of Lunar Lake, which he described as &#8220;the most compelling AI PC product ever.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel has engaged advisors, including Morgan Stanley, to fend off activist investor scrutiny. Gelsinger did not address the recent departure of board member<strong> Lip-Bu Tan</strong>, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40624703/nvidia-to-rally-over-31-here-are-10-top-analyst-forecasts-for-thursday?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NVIDIA To Rally Over 31%?

Gelsinger believes these efforts will yield positive results, citing &#8220;signals&#8221; from external foundry customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $1.61 billion, compared to a net income of $1.48 billion in the same period last year, with <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40134853/intels-earnings-disappoint-analyst-points-to-operational-missteps\">revenue missing estimates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Intel&#8217;s recent struggles are part of a broader context in the semiconductor industry. The departure of board member Tan was a significant event, as he left after <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40593141/intel-board-member-lip-bu-tan-reportedly-left-after-disputes-with-ceo-and-other-directors-over-c\">disagreements with CEO Gelsinger</a> and other directors over the company&#8217;s direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had joined Intel to help <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40593141/intel-board-member-lip-bu-tan-reportedly-left-after-disputes-with-ceo-and-other-directors-over-c\">restore its status</a> as a leading global chipmaker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Intel&#8217;s job cuts come at a time when the company is competing for <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/08/40622868/intel-faces-scrutiny-over-job-cuts-while-competing-for-20b-us-chip-subsidy\">a $20 billion U.S. chip subsidy</a> aimed at creating thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs. This has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers, especially since the U.S. strategy aims to reduce dependence on Asian semiconductor technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Intel&#8217;s challenges are set against the backdrop of strong performance by competitors like <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>). Nvidia recently reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, which has further highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40614118/nvidia-leads-semiconductor-stocks-lower-following-q2-earnings-what-investors-need-to-know\">competitive pressures Intel faces</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&#8217;s stock surge has also turned many of its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40573254/nvidias-stock-surge-turns-employees-into-millionaires-cutting-churn-to-record-low-report\">employees into millionaires</a>, reducing employee churn to record lows. The chip designer is known for its demanding work environment, where employees slog up to seven days a week, with work hours stretching until 2 a.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action</strong>: Intel&#8217;s stock closed at $20.13 on Thursday, up 2.65% for the day. After hours, it edged up by 0.50%. Despite this, the stock has declined by 57.89% year to date. In contrast, Nvidia has seen a substantial rise this year, with a year-to-date gain of 144.11%, and is currently trading at $117.59, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">data from Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40568347/after-binance-and-coinbase-gary-gensler-led-sec-set-to-lock-horns-with-crypto-exchange-kra?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">After Binance And Coinbase, Gary Gensler-Led SEC Set To Lock Horns With Crypto Exchange Kraken</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Image Via Shutterstock </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Kaustubh-Bagalkote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kaustubh Bagalkote</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T05:19:48Z", "headline": "Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger Says He Respects Market 'Skepticism' Even As Rival Nvidia Shot Up 144% This Year: 'We're Up For The Challenge'", "id": 40644651, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Intel.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Intel.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Intel.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Intel Corp CEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledged investor concerns following a significant drop in the company&#39;s stock price", "symbols": ["INTC", "NVDA"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T05:19:48Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40644651/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-says-he-respects-market-skepticism-even-as-rival-nvidia-shot-up-144-this"}

{"author": "Anan Ashraf", "content": "<p>The world&#8217;s top-selling automaker, <strong>Toyota Motor</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TM#NYSE\">TM</a>), is not exempt from the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39666123/teslas-market-share-in-china-drops-in-june-as-ev-sales-drop-by-more-than-20-over-2023\">intense competition</a> permeating the Chinese auto market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Toyota said on Wednesday that it sold 928,056 vehicles in China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the seven months till the end of July, marking a year-on-year drop of 10%. The sales numbers include the company&#8217;s luxury brand, Lexus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese automaker said that sales in the region were affected by &#8220;severe market conditions&#8221; including intensifying price competition. The company implemented sales activities such as enhancement measures over the past month, but couldn&#8217;t pull its sales up to meet the numbers from 2023, it added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota&#8217;s worldwide sales are down 0.8% this year as of the end of July at 5,750,240 units. While its sales outside of Japan have increased by 3.1% in the period, its sales within its home ground have dropped by a significant 19%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Toyota is not the only automaker affected by the tough market conditions in China. According to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), American EV giant and the world&#8217;s top EV seller Tesla&#8217;s retail sales in China in the January-July period were 324,544 units, down 0.3% year-on-year, as <a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2024/08/09/automakers-share-of-china-nev-market-jul-2024/\">reported</a> by CnEVPost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese EV giant&nbsp;<strong>BYD Co Ltd</strong>, however, said earlier this month that its passenger vehicle sales rose 29% year-on-year to 1,947,944 units in the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40123403/warren-buffett-backed-byds-pure-ev-sales-drop-to-lowest-in-five-months-in-july-while-hybrid-vehicle\">seven months as of the end of July</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EV market in China is currently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/asia/24/04/38141148/chinas-newest-ev-entrant-ignites-another-fierce-price-war-even-small-fry-feel-the-heat\">witnessing heightened competition</a> as EV makers slash prices on their offerings in a bid to retain share amidst market weakness. The drawn-out price war, however, is weighing heavily on the companies&#8217; margins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EVs form a significant chunk of China&#8217;s overall auto market.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p><strong>Tyson Foods</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSN#NYSE\">TSN</a>) has decided not to reinstate <strong>John R. Tyson</strong> as its Chief Financial Officer following his suspension earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>:  John R. Tyson, the former CFO of Tyson Foods, will not be reinstated to his previous role at the company. Tyson Foods had placed him on suspension following his <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39800909/tyson-foods-cfo-pleads-not-guilty-on-driving-while-intoxicated-charges-wsj\">arrest for driving while intoxicated</a> in mid-June. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, the company <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases/2024/8/tyson-foods-names-curt-calaway-chief-financial-officer\">announced</a> that <strong>Curt Calaway</strong>, who had been serving as interim CFO, will now assume the position permanently. John Tyson will remain an employee on a health-related leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calaway, 50, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/100493/000010049324000106/tsn-20240829.htm\">received</a> a salary increase to $675,000 and is eligible for a potential cash bonus of $742,500 this year, along with another possible $300,000. His appointment as interim CFO was effective from June 13. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calaway&#8217;s total potential compensation of $1.7 million is significantly lower than the $2.9 million compensation package John R. Tyson received in 2023 when he held both the CFO and chief sustainability officer roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John R. Tyson, the great-grandson of founder <strong>John W. Tyson</strong>, had a tumultuous tenure at the company since joining in 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He became the youngest CFO in the Fortune 500 in 2022 at age 32. However, his career faced challenges, including a bizarre incident in 2022 where he was found asleep in a stranger&#8217;s bed, leading to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39800909/tyson-foods-cfo-pleads-not-guilty-on-driving-while-intoxicated-charges-wsj\">charges of trespassing and public intoxication</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40617471/former-trump-aide-anthony-scaramucci-says-secs-gary-gensler-wants-kamala-harris-to-lose-up?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Former Trump Aide Anthony Scaramucci Says SEC&#8217;s Gary Gensler Wants Kamala Harris To Lose Upcoming Election After NFT Platform OpenSea Receives Wells Notice</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The leadership shakeup at Tyson Foods comes at a crucial time for the company. In early July, Tyson Foods announced the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/07/39705369/tyson-foods-divests-georgia-plant-in-profitability-push\">sale of its poultry complex in Vienna, Georgia</a>, to <strong>House of Raeford Farms </strong>as part of its strategy to optimize its plant network. This move is part of Tyson Foods' ongoing efforts to enhance profitability and streamline operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the company has been scaling back its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/07/39594565/tyson-reduces-antibiotic-free-beef-options-as-costs-rise-report\">antibiotic-free beef products</a> due to rising costs and increased regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, Tyson Foods reported <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40158875/tyson-foods-surpasses-q3-expectations-with-beef-and-pork-gains-chicken-segment-falls-short\">strong third-quarter results</a>, with beef and pork segments showing gains, although the chicken segment fell short. The company&#8217;s quarterly adjusted earnings per share of 87 cents beat the street view of 65 cents, and sales of $13.353 billion surpassed analyst expectations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action</strong>: Tyson Foods&#8217; stock closed at $64.65 on Thursday, down 1.58% for the day. In after-hours trading, the stock slightly declined by 0.31%.

An analyst at Morgan Stanley on Thursday offered his take on what to expect from the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stock Implications: </strong>Apple shares will likely perform In line with the typicality of the iPhone launch event, when they underperform the market (by about 60 basis points) on launch day and then merely modestly outperform the market (by 3 basis points on the average) in the three months following the event, said analyst <strong>Erik Woodring</strong> in a note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the analyst did not rule out of the possibility the stock performing better than historical seasonality, given his expectations that the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence will likely unlock pent-up demand. He estimates that the iPhone&#8217;s upgradable base is currently 40% larger than ahead of the 5G cycle. The iPhone replacement cycle, which currently has a peak value of 4.8 years, will likely accelerate, he said, saying it is the &#8220;key factor&#8221; for the Apple stock being a top pick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, Apple shares underperform when replacement cycles contract and underperform when replacement cycles are elongated, Woodring said. This, the analyst, said creates a positive setup as he sees a contraction in iPhone replacement cycles through 2026 ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-apple-stock\">How To Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s In Store:</strong> Woodring expects Apple to launch the iPhone 16 family, new Apple Watch models, Series X and Ultra 3, and potentially new AirPods. For the flagship iPhones, the analyst looks forward to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Catch-up upgrades for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, and the addition of an Action button</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More pronounced component upgrades for iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max such as\n<ul>\n<li>Thinner bezels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Larger display and slightly larger form factor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A periscope lens for iPhone 16 Pro.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New, faster A18 Pro chipset, potentially having more neural engine cores for enhanced AI capabilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved battery capacity, and a metal casing to improve heat dissipation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming iPhone 16 will likely add the Capture button across the lineup, which would act like a shutter button on a digital camera, Woodring said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst expects preorders to start Friday, Sept. 13, with in-store availability/shipments, beginning on Friday, Sept. 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3 Focus Areas:</strong> Woodring said he would focus on three aspects, namely the iPhone pricing, iPhone battery life, and any new Apple Intelligence features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will likely price all iPhone 16 models the same as their like-for-like iPhone 15 counterparts, Woodring said. The analyst, however, expects Apple to eliminate the 128GB iPhone Pro SKU, priced at $999. This will render the starting price of the iPhone 16 Pro at $1,099.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst expects the iPhone 16 to make up 68% of Apple&#8217;s fiscal year 2025 iPhone shipments, up from the 66% that the iPhone 15 accounted for in the previous year. He estimates the iPhone&#8217;s average selling price to rise 5% year-over-year in 2025. Citing Morgan Stanley&#8217;s sensitivity analysis using different pricing/mix factors, every 1% increase in the iPhone ASP will translate to 3 cents per share earnings per share upside in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citing reports, Woodring said Apple will likely bring a new and about 10% larger capacity battery to the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. This is important considering the amount of computing power Apple&#8217;s on-device LLMs will likely use, he said. &#8220;We believe a strong battery upgrade can help to drive old device refreshes, given battery life is one of the key reasons users historically upgrade,&#8221; he said, adding that every 1% increase in iPhone shipments will equate to about 50-basis-point earnings per share upside in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Apple Intelligence will likely play a &#8220;starring role in the iPhone 16 launch event, with &#8216;Glowtime&#8217; almost certainly a reference to the new Siri user interface in iOS18,&#8221; said Woodring. That said, he expects Apple Intelligence feature introductions<br>to be staggered through this Fall. &#8220;The more that Apple teases the performance of Apple Intelligence on the new iPhone 16 models with 8GB of DRAM and a more powerful processor, the greater the odds of consumers associating Apple Intelligence with needing a new iPhone,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Potential Wildcards: </strong>Although Morgan Stanley currently factors in status quo prices, Apple could spring a surprise by raising the new iPhone prices, said Woodring. The year-over-year price increases could prove to be a net negative for Apple, as it would lead some upgraders to extend the useful life of their iPhone for another year, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39267314/will-your-iphone-support-new-apple-intelligence-features-heres-what-you-need-to-know\">new Apple Intelligence features, or new language support</a>, are also key wildcards to watch for, the analyst said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is skeptical about the AirPods Pro 3 launch at the event, given the company&#8217;s Wearables, Home and<br>Accessories segment has underperformed the rest</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woodring also mentioned the aggressiveness of wireless carriers for the new iPhone launch and year-over-year changes in trade-in values, given the limited backward compatibility of Apple Intelligence, as wildcards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and a $273 price target for the stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Apple ended Thursday&#8217;s session up 1.46% at $229.79, according to <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga&#8217;s Consumer Tech coverage by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/consumer-tech\">following this link.</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38661417/apple-will-pursue-aggressive-and-no-holds-barred-strategy-around-ai-says-bullish-an\"><strong>Apple Will Pursue &#8216;Aggressive And No Holds Barred Strategy Around AI,&#8217; Says Bullish Analyst: &#8216;Worst Is In Rearview Mirror&#8217;</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Apple</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T07:57:12Z", "headline": "Apple Intelligence Will Play 'Starring Role' In iPhone 16 Launch, Says Analyst: No Price Hike Expected, But Accelerating Replacement Cycle 'Key Factor' For The Stock", "id": 40645921, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Apple-Intelligence.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Apple-Intelligence.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Apple-Intelligence.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Apple&#39;s upcoming iPhone 16 launch is hyped up as a key event that could set in motion a massive upgrade cycle.", "symbols": ["AAPL"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T07:57:13Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40645921/apple-intelligence-will-play-starring-role-in-iphone-16-launch-says-analyst-no-pric"}

This action follows a previous recall issued in November 2020. The issue involves roof trim panels that may have insufficient primer, which could cause them to detach from the vehicle over time, posing a safety risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla will begin the recall on Oct. 8. The company will inspect the affected vehicles and perform a tension test on the roof trim panels. If the panels fail the test, they will be replaced and reinstalled with an application of primer at no cost to the vehicle owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40591746/jd-vance-lashes-out-at-kamala-harris-for-allowing-chinese-battery-plant-in-michigan-she-wants-to-pay?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JD Vance Lashes Out At Kamala Harris For Allowing Chinese Battery Plant In Michigan</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This latest recall is part of a series of recalls that Tesla has issued over the past year. Last week, the company recalled over 9,000 Model X vehicles in the U.S. due to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40481070/tesla-recalls-over-9k-units-of-older-model-x-suvs-over-concerns-of-cosmetic-trim-pieces-on-roof-fall\">concerns that the roof trim pieces</a> might separate and pose a hazard to other drivers. This recall also involved Model X vehicles from the 2016 model year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, in May, Tesla recalled <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/05/39106633/breaking-tesla-recalls-over-125-000-cars-to-fix-faulty-seat-belt-warnings\">over 125,000 vehicles</a> in the U.S. to address issues with seat belt warnings. The recall was prompted by a malfunction in the seat belt warning light and chime, which could fail to activate, increasing the risk of injury in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in June, the company recalled more than 11,000 Cybertrucks due to concerns that the sail applique might detach while driving, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39473764/tesla-recalls-more-than-11-000-cybertrucks-over-applique-detachment-risk-and-nearly-12-000-for-winds\">posing a risk to other motorists</a>. Nearly 12,000 Cybertrucks were also recalled for windshield wiper flaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another significant recall, this month Tesla recalled 1.7 million vehicles in China over concerns that the front trunk <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40211414/tesla-recalls-1-7m-vehicles-in-china-over-concerns-of-front-trunk-opening-when-driving-after-recalli\">might open while driving</a>, obstructing the driver&#8217;s view and increasing the risk of a crash.

This comes in the wake of reports suggesting <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40636153/apple-in-talks-to-invest-in-openai-as-chatgpt-makers-valuation-climbs-to-100b-report\">potential investments from tech giants</a> such as <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) and <strong>Nvidia Corp.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: On Friday, Musk responded to a user&#8217;s query about the legality of OpenAI&#8217;s transition to a for-profit model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user noted that Apple is reportedly in discussions to invest in OpenAI, joining Microsoft in valuing the company at over $100 billion. The user said that this raises questions about whether Musk, who initially funded OpenAI, should be entitled to a share of this value. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also questioned the legality of the company accepting donations, converting the resulting intellectual property into a for-profit venture, and then pocketing the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40591783/apples-september-9-glowtime-event-featuring-iphone-16-launch-could-kickstart-a-historical-period-say?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple&#8217;s September 9 &#8216;Glowtime&#8217; Event Featuring iPhone 16 Launch Could Kickstart A &#8216;Historical Period,&#8217; Says Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the tech billionaire stated,&nbsp;&#8220;Either turning a non-profit into&nbsp;a for-profit is legal and&nbsp;everyone should be doing it&nbsp;or it's illegal and OpenAI&nbsp;is a house of cards.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Either turning a non-profit into a for-profit is legal and everyone should be doing it or it's illegal and OpenAI is a house of cards.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1829400635709575595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Subscribe to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://bztechtrends.beehiiv.com/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter</em></a><em>&nbsp;to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This isn&#8217;t the first time Musk has raised concerns about OpenAI&#8217;s operations.

So far, Microsoft&#8217;s investment in OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39550891/microsofts-13b-investment-in-openai-under-eu-scrutiny\">reportedly valued at up to $13 billion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga&#8217;s Consumer Tech coverage by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/consumer-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>following this link</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40545254/mark-cuban-asks-elon-musk-to-share-source-code-of-algorithm-that-decides-reputation-relevancy-and-si?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mark Cuban Asks Elon Musk To Share Source Code Of Algorithm That Decides Reputation, Relevancy, And Similarity Criteria Of Posts On X</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong><em>\u00a0This content was partially produced with the help of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Neuro</a>\u00a0and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T09:51:06Z", "headline": "Elon Musk Questions Legality Of OpenAI Going From Non-Profit To For-Profit Amid Apple, Nvidia Investment Buzz: 'OpenAI Is A House Of Cards'", "id": 40647123, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/OpenAI-Musk--Shutterstock-1.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/OpenAI-Musk--Shutterstock-1.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/OpenAI-Musk--Shutterstock-1.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Elon Musk has raised concerns about the legality of OpenAI&#39;s shift from a non-profit to a for-profit model amidst reports of potential investments from tech giants like Apple and Nvidia, questioning whether such a transition is lawful or if OpenAI is operating on shaky legal grounds.", "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T09:51:06Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40647123/elon-musk-questions-legality-of-openai-going-from-non-profit-to-for-profit-amid-apple-nvidia-investm"}

LPL Financial&#8217;s Chief Technical Strategist <strong>Adam Turnquist</strong> said Friday&#8217;s inflation report and next week's jobs data could dictate the size of the September cut. Another weak employment report would likely push probabilities toward a 0.50% reduction, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We believe a soft landing is still viable but not guaranteed, setting stocks up for a potential volatile fall, likely exacerbated by the November election,&#8221; Turnquist said. He noted that stocks have historically traded flat to negative in the first few months after a rate-cutting cycle begins but tend to move higher over the following 12 months, with the drawdowns during these 12 months tending to be more severe. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Upcoming Economic Data</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the July personal income and spending report at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

A lack of clarity on the Blackwell 200 delay also hurt sentiment to some extent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors&#8217; fears may be unfounded, going by sell-side reactions to the earnings report.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>In a bold move to challenge<strong> Elon Musk</strong>&#8216;s <strong>Tesla Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>), Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, <strong>Zeekr</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ZK#NYSE\">ZK</a>), is set to release its first SUV, priced to undercut Tesla&#8217;s Model Y in the Chinese market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Zeekr announced on Friday that it will launch its first SUV, the Zeekr 7X, in China next month. The new vehicle is priced at 239,900 yuan ($33,829), over $1,400 less than Tesla&#8217;s Model Y in China. The company plans to deliver the 7X globally by the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zeekr 7X is equipped with two battery options that allow users to drive between 605 kilometers and 780 kilometers on a single charge. The company claims that its lithium-ion phosphate batteries offer the fastest charge in the world, beating Tesla&#8217;s, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/chinas-zeekr-to-launch-first-electric-suv-priced-to-undercut-teslas-model-y.html\">reported</a> on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> China&#8217;s EV market is currently experiencing a fierce price war. Earlier, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40646699/teslas-china-woes-just-got-worse-xpengs-model-3-killer-receives-over-30k-orders-in-48-hours-of-l\">Xpeng released its mass-market Mona M03</a> with models starting at less than $17,000. In May, Nio launched a lower-cost brand, Onvo, with cars priced $4,000 cheaper than Tesla&#8217;s Model Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40550115/horror-show-for-teslas-q3-margins-says-analyst-as-elon-musk-led-company-extends-zero-percent-financi?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Horror Show&#8217; For Tesla&#8217;s Q3 Margins, Says Analyst, As Elon Musk-Led Company Extends Zero-Percent Financing To End Of Q3</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Chinese EV makers continue to release new models at lower prices, Tesla&#8217;s competitive edge in the market appears to be waning. A 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study released in June showed that Tesla was losing its lead over legacy automakers due to quality concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, Tesla&#8217;s China Model Y prices have remained unchanged for nine consecutive weeks. In July, Zeekr sold 15,655 cars, a 30% year-on-year growth, while Tesla sold 46, 227 cars, a year-on-year rise of 47%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Zeekr, a subsidiary of Chinese automaker <strong>Geely Automobile</strong>, made a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/38774344/chinese-tesla-rival-zeekr-soars-35-on-nyse-debut-valuation-hits-6-8b\">strong debut on the NYSE</a> in May 2024, with its shares closing nearly 35% higher than its initial public offering price. The company&#8217;s aggressive pricing strategy for the Zeekr 7X appears to be a continuation of this momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Zeekr <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40506586/whats-going-on-with-chinese-ev-brand-zeekr-stock-today\">plans to introduce a hybrid model</a> in the latter half of 2025, equipped with Nvidia's Drive Thor autonomous driving chip. This move could potentially increase its market share in the EV sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Musk has <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39354617/can-elon-musks-tesla-really-pull-off-a-20k-model-y-industry-experts-have-mixed-feelings\">hinted at the possibility</a> of a Tesla Model Y priced under $20,000.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>As the cost of living continues to rise in the U.S., an increasing number of Americans are taking on multiple jobs to make ends meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Individuals are finding it necessary to supplement their income with additional work, some spending almost 60 hours every week working, including weekends. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals that the percentage of people holding more than one job rose to 5.3% in July, up from 5.2% in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This figure is significantly higher than the pandemic low of 4% in April 2020, and slightly above the average of 4.94% from 2010 through 2019, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/workers-multiple-jobs-lifestyle-economy-344c8f10\">reported</a> on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise in multiple-job holders reflects the mixed currents in an economy that still boasts a growing job market, but is also grappling with higher prices across a broad variety of goods and services, including essentials like rent and insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christopher Taber</strong>, chairman of the economics department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, suggests that the emergence of the gig economy and the expansion of work-from-home jobs have made it easier for people to find second jobs with less commuting, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40619332/after-endorsing-trump-for-president-elon-musk-now-hires-republican-strategist-signaling-a-deeper-div?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">After Endorsing Trump For President, Elon Musk Now Hires Republican Strategist, Signaling A Deeper Dive Into Politics</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the potential softening of the labor market in the months ahead, Taber believes that the number of people holding two jobs might remain high due to the long-term trend of working from home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Government data shows that individuals who take on second jobs are more likely to be divorced or widowed. In interviews, many second-job holders revealed that they balance a full-time job with a second part-time gig on nights or weekends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The trend of Americans holding multiple jobs has been on the rise. In January, a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/01/36829541/8-7-million-americans-now-work-two-jobs-to-make-ends-meet-despite-inflation-continuing-to-cool\">report noted that </a>8.7 million Americans were balancing two jobs, a number that has been growing by hundreds of thousands per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By August, some individuals were even managing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/08/40541567/100-hour-weeks-worth-it-for-this-gen-xer-secretly-working-multiple-jobs-and-earning-150-000-the-answ\">multiple full-time jobs</a>. Despite the challenges, these individuals found the financial security worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, this trend persists even as the U.S. economy shows signs of robust growth. The <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/08/40541567/100-hour-weeks-worth-it-for-this-gen-xer-secretly-working-multiple-jobs-and-earning-150-000-the-answ\">U.S. economy expanded</a> by 3% in the second quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40643937/mark-cuban-wants-someone-to-explain-to-him-how-trump-would-tax-a-foreign-nation?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mark Cuban Wants Someone To Explain To Him How Trump &#8216;Would Tax A Foreign Nation&#8217;</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Pooja-Rajkumari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pooja Rajkumari</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T11:54:48Z", "headline": "Americans Are Juggling Multiple Jobs Over 60 Hours Every Week To Pay Their Bills Despite Unemployment Rates Trending Upwards", "id": 40649739, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Happy-Woman--Barista-And-Serving-Custome.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Happy-Woman--Barista-And-Serving-Custome.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Happy-Woman--Barista-And-Serving-Custome.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Rising living costs in the US have led to more people working multiple jobs, some spending 60 hours per week.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T11:54:48Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/08/40649739/americans-are-juggling-multiple-jobs-over-60-hours-every-week-to-pay-their-bills-"}

Dollar General serves as a convenient shopping destination for fill-in store trips, with its value proposition most relevant to consumers in small communities with a dearth of shopping options. The retailer operates a frugal store of about 7,500 square feet and primarily offers an assortment of branded and private-label consumable items (80% of net sales) such as paper and cleaning products, packaged and perishable food, tobacco, and health and beauty items at low prices. Dollar General also offers a limited assortment of seasonal merchandise, home products, and apparel. The firm sells most items at a price point of $10 or less.</p>\n<h3>Dollar Gen: Financial Performance Dissected</h3>\n<p><strong>Market Capitalization Analysis:</strong> The company's market capitalization is below the industry average, suggesting that it is relatively smaller compared to peers. This could be due to various factors, including perceived growth potential or operational scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Revenue Trend:</strong> Examining Dollar Gen's financials over 3 months reveals a positive narrative. The company achieved a noteworthy revenue growth rate of <strong>6.11%</strong> as of 30 April, 2024, showcasing a substantial increase in top-line earnings. As compared to competitors, the company encountered difficulties, with a growth rate lower than the average among peers in the Consumer Staples sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Margin:</strong> Dollar Gen's net margin excels beyond industry benchmarks, reaching <strong>3.66%</strong>. This signifies efficient cost management and strong financial health.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Dollar Gen's ROE surpasses industry standards, highlighting the company's exceptional financial performance. With an impressive <strong>5.28%</strong> ROE, the company effectively utilizes shareholder equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> The company's ROA is below industry benchmarks, signaling potential difficulties in efficiently utilizing assets. With an ROA of <strong>1.18%,</strong> the company may need to address challenges in generating satisfactory returns from its assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Debt Management:</strong> Dollar Gen's debt-to-equity ratio stands notably higher than the industry average, reaching <strong>2.59</strong>. This indicates a heavier reliance on borrowed funds, raising concerns about financial leverage.</p>\n<h2>How Are Analyst Ratings Determined?</h2>\n<p>Experts in banking and financial systems, analysts specialize in reporting for specific stocks or defined sectors. Their comprehensive research involves attending company conference calls and meetings, analyzing financial statements, and engaging with insiders to generate what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts assess and rate each stock once per quarter.</p>\n<p>Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep track of which analysts are outperforming others, you can view updated analyst ratings along withanalyst success scores in <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T12:00:43Z", "headline": "Dollar Gen Stock: A Deep Dive Into Analyst Perspectives (13 Ratings)", "id": 40649854, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["DG"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T12:00:44Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/analyst-ratings/24/08/40649854/dollar-gen-stock-a-deep-dive-into-analyst-perspectives-13-ratings"}

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>In a significant move, <strong>Amazon.com Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>) is reportedly gearing up to revamp its voice assistant, Alexa, using <strong>Anthropic&#8217;s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/claude\">Claude AI models</a>, replacing its own AI. The new version, set for an October release, is designed to answer complex queries more efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The overhauled Alexa, set to launch in October, will primarily utilize Anthropic&#8217;s Claude artificial intelligence models, reported Reuters. This move comes after the initial versions of the new Alexa, built with in-house software, struggled to respond to prompts promptly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon intends to charge $5 to $10 a month for its new &#8220;Remarkable&#8221; version of Alexa, which will leverage powerful generative AI to answer complex queries. The &#8220;Classic&#8221; voice assistant will continue to be available for free, the report added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s efforts to generate revenue through shopping via Alexa have not been very successful, making 2024 a pivotal year for Alexa to demonstrate its profitability. The revamped paid version is seen as a strategy to achieve this and compete with rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Subscribe to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://bztechtrends.beehiiv.com/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter</em></a><em>&nbsp;to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has generally refrained from depending on technology it hasn&#8217;t developed internally. However, it&#8217;s not alone in turning to a partner to enhance AI products. Companies like <strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> have also partnered with <strong>OpenAI </strong>to power some of their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon holds a minority stake in Anthropic, the developer of Claude AI. Anthropic has yet to respond to Benzinga&#8217;s queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40591783/apples-september-9-glowtime-event-featuring-iphone-16-launch-could-kickstart-a-historical-period-say?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple&#8217;s September 9 &#8216;Glowtime&#8217; Event Featuring iPhone 16 Launch Could Kickstart A &#8216;Historical Period,&#8217; Says Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Amazon&#8217;s partnership with Anthropic, a company it invested in back in September 2023, is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40255295/amazons-4b-stake-in-anthropic-under-uk-investigation-for-anti-competitive-concerns\">currently under investigation</a> by a U.K. regulator for potential anti-competitive concerns. This investigation could pose a setback to the artificial intelligence sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in June, Amazon announced plans for a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/06/39433128/amazon-plans-major-alexa-overhaul-with-ai-powered-features-report\">major overhaul of its Alexa service</a>, integrating conversational generative AI. This project, known internally as \"Banyan,\" was set to introduce a two-tier system with a premium version potentially costing around $5 monthly. This marked the first major update to the voice assistant since its 2014 launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Alexa&#8217;s presence in millions of households worldwide, the smart technology has been a significant cost to Amazon. The company launched its first Echo smart speaker with Alexa in 2014, but it wasn&#8217;t until 2017 that the smart speaker gained global popularity, thanks to third-party products and integrations. However, Alexa has <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/07/39989151/hey-alexa-why-are-you-costing-amazon-billions\">been a financial drain</a> on Amazon&#8217;s profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just days before the announcement of Alexa&#8217;s overhaul, Anthropic released updates to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40594722/google-amazon-backed-openai-rival-anthropic-releases-system-prompts-that-run-claude\">default system prompts </a>for text-based dialogues on its AI platform, Claude.ai, as well as the Claude iOS and Android applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of&nbsp;Benzinga's&nbsp;Consumer Tech coverage by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/consumer-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>following this link</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40594137/heres-what-nvidias-jensen-huang-had-to-say-about-amd-ceo-and-his-cousin-lisa-su?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here&#8217;s What Nvidia&#8217;s Jensen Huang Had To Say About AMD CEO And His Cousin Lisa Su</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Pooja-Rajkumari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pooja Rajkumari</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T12:21:12Z", "headline": "Amazon Leverages Anthropic's Claude AI To Transform Alexa Before Holiday Season: Report", "id": 40650406, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Amazon-Alexa.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Amazon-Alexa.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Amazon-Alexa.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Amazon to revamp Alexa using Anthropic&#39;s AI models for Oct release.

Some have urged Harris to remove the tax proposals from her election manifesto, according to a New York Times report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the backlash, proponents argue that the tax plan addresses inequality in the US tax system, which currently favors income from wealth over income from labor. However, the proposal faces significant political opposition and potential legal challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40596411/nasdaq-s-p-500-futures-flatline-as-traders-await-earnings-report-from-ai-barometer-nvidia-fund-mana?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wall Street On Wait-and-Watch Mode Ahead Of Nvidia Earnings</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The proposed tax plan is a continuation of the policies of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/08/40485064/wall-street-labels-kamala-harris-proposed-tax-on-unrealized-gains-as-dumb-move-opposite-of-creating\">the Biden administration</a>, where Harris has played a key role.

This suggests that the appetite for speculation has declined and suggests a more spot-dominated market regime for the time being,&#8221; the report states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This decline in speculation is further evidenced by the ratio between price and net liquidation volume volatility, which is approaching levels not seen since February 2022. &#8220;Traders are less willing to take on higher-risk positions, suggesting there has been a significant reset in speculative interest.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors should be wary though since &#8220;periods of quiet and calm market structure are short-lived and often precede an expectation for heightened volatility,&#8221; the report warns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong>: For investors and industry professionals seeking to understand these complex market dynamics, Benzinga&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\">Future of Digital Assets</a> event on Nov. 19 offers a timely opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40623075/bitcoin-ethereum-have-left-ftx-collapse-behind-but-microstrategy-has-outperformed-report\">Bitcoin, Ethereum Have Left FTX Collapse Behind, But MicroStrategy Has Outperformed: Report</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ", "created_at": "2024-08-30T13:00:26Z", "headline": "Underwater Bitcoin Buyers Refuse To Book Losses, But On-Chain Data Shows This May Be The Calm Before The Storm", "id": 40651187, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/blockchain-bitcoin-MSTR-CLSK.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/blockchain-bitcoin-MSTR-CLSK.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/blockchain-bitcoin-MSTR-CLSK.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "A substantial portion of Bitcoin supply is moving into Long-Term Holder (LTH) status, despite recent market turbulence and a marked decrease in speculative activity, on-chain data shows.", "symbols": ["BTCUSD"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T13:00:27Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40651187/underwater-bitcoin-buyers-refuse-to-book-losses-but-on-chain-data-shows-this-may-be-the-ca"}

{"author": "Avi Kapoor", "content": "<p><strong>Di</strong>ck&#8217;s<strong> Sporting Goods, Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DKS#NYSE\">DKS</a>) is projected to post revenue of $3.44 billion when it releases second-quarter, earnings on Wednesday, Sept. 4, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent buzz around Dick&#8217;s, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, the company has a dividend yield of 1.87%. That&#8217;s a quarterly dividend amount of $1.10 a share ($4.40 a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Dick&#8217;s, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we take this amount and divide it by Dick's $4.40 dividend: $6,000 / $4.40 = 1,364 shares</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, an investor would need to own approximately $320,622 worth of Dick's, or 1,364 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $4.40 = 273 shares, or $64,171 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%.

{"author": "Upwallstreet", "content": "<p>On Wednesday, a prominent EV player, Li Auto (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LI#NASDAQ\">LI</a>), issued better-than-expected the second quarter report. However, even though the price war Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) initiated a while is eating up margins, Li Auto and BYD (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BYDDY#OTC\">BYDDY</a>) remain the only profitable Chinese EV makers. Also, Li Auto regained its leading position in Chinese new energy SUV sales, having surpassed Tesla in July when it comes to unit sales.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite thinned margins, Li Auto and BYD are still&nbsp;profitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BYD, the world&rsquo;s largest EV maker, reported earnings of 9.1 billion yuan, which is about $1.28 billion, for its second quarter that ended in June. In other words, BYD reported its earnings almost doubled from the prior, fiscal first, quarter and rose 32.8% compared to last year&rsquo;s comparable quarter, while delivering a record 986,720 pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Li Auto&rsquo;s Second Quarter Highlights</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the quarter ended on June 30th, Li Auto reported vehicle deliveries grew 25.5% YoY.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Net income experienced a significant year-over-year decline of 52.3% as it halved to 1.10 billion yuan, which is about $154.4 million. On the other hand, sales only grew about 10% YoY to about $4.4 billion but still surpassing Wall Street&rsquo;s estimate of $4.31 billion. But operating expenses increased by 23.9% YoY and gross margin, slipped to 19.5%, down from 21.8% reported during last year&rsquo;s comparable quarter. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid guidance despite a persistently challenging EV environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the third quarter, Li Auto guided for deliveries in the range between 45,000 and 155,000 vehicles, which would represent a YoY increase between 38.0% and 47.5% with sales coming in between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion,&nbsp;representing YoY growth from 13.7% to 21.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite intense competition from BYD, Tesla and others, Li Auto turned the setbacks into a comeback.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Auto&#39;s second-quarter earnings call painted a picture of a company that is not only navigating the competitive electric vehicle market successfully with BYD&rsquo;s dominance taking a toll on smaller EV rivals, but is also making strategic moves to ensure its continued growth as well as leadership when it comes to the higher-end NEV market.&nbsp;Therefore, Li Auto did more than just demonstrate its resilience, standing proudly next to BYD and Tesla. Second quarter profit did slump with slower sales growth and thinned margins, but Li Auto remains among the handful of profitable EV makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This has supported the Reserve Bank of Australia&#39;s (RBA) decision to maintain a tight monetary policy stance. Despite the challenges in effectively curbing high inflation, the RBA has adopted a watchful rather than aggressive approach, which could yield favourable outcomes over a longer horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the last RBA meeting, discussions were held regarding a potential rate hike, though it was ultimately decided to keep rates unchanged. The RBA&#39;s cautious approach, combined with the earlier general weakness of the US dollar, has provided a solid backdrop for the Australian dollar&#39;s strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>AUD/USD Technical Analysis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/audusdh4_15.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/audusdh4_15.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the H4 chart, AUD/USD recently completed an upward wave to 0.6822, followed by a downward impulse to 0.6784. Currently, a corrective movement to 0.6816 is anticipated, potentially establishing the upper limits of the consolidation range. A downward exit from this range could initiate a new decline to 0.6760. A break below this level might signal the start of a new downward trend towards 0.6640, with a potential continuation to 0.6575. The MACD indicator supports this bearish scenario, with its signal line at the highs and trending downward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/audusdh1_14.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/audusdh1_14.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the H1 chart, the pair is forming a correction to 0.6816. Following this correction, a downward movement to 0.6764 is expected, potentially extending to 0.6757. The Stochastic oscillator, currently above 80, indicates a likely decline to 20, supporting the possibility of continued downward momentum after the correction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disclaimer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author&#39;s particular opinion.

(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AZO#NYSE\">AZO</a>), signaling a shift from net selling to buying. This shift is a key indicator of rising investor confidence and the potential for an uptrend in AZO&#8217;s stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 10:41 AM ET on August 29th, AZO registered a Power Inflow at a price of $3200.11. Following this signal, the stock reached its high point at 1:02 EDT, climbing over 29&nbsp; points ($3230.02) during the day, translating to an approximate increase of 0.9%. This alert is crucial for investors relying on order flow analytics, suggesting the beginning of an uptrend and presenting a valuable opportunity for those anticipating higher prices. Observers are now closely monitoring AZO for sustained positive momentum, viewing this as a bullish sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power Inflows are crucial as they offer early indications of potential uptrends, enabling traders to act even before the market fully adjusts. Such a change is commonly viewed as a sign of larger inflows than retail is capable of producing, indicating institutional interest and a short-term uptrend in the stock. Although not always marking the lowest point, stocks tend to rise following a Power Inflow. This makes these signals especially valuable for identifying strategic entry points and planning short-term investments, as they provide an opportunity to capitalize on upward momentum ahead of wider market recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strategic Actions Following a Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After detecting a Power Inflow, traders should view it as a potential entry buying point but also confirm the trend with TradePulse's additional indicators such as Momentum, Daily, and Large Deal flows to ensure its strength and viability. Prompt action, combined with strategic stop-loss settings, can maximize returns and minimize risks. This comprehensive approach allows traders to make more informed decisions, optimizing their trading strategies in alignment with real-time market dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to stay updated on the latest options trades for AutoZone Inc.,<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\"> Benzinga Pro</a> gives you real-time options trade alerts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.com/apis?_gl=1&#x2A;1hlgn5i&#x2A;_ga&#x2A;MTY1NjE2NTYxMi4xNzE0NzQ4MTAy&#x2A;_ga_V7ZK73W7N0&#x2A;MTcxNDc0ODEwMi4xLjEuMTcxNDc0ODQyOC4wLjAuMA..\">Market News and Data are brought to you by Benzinga APIs</a> and include firms, like<a href=\"https://finitusa.com/en/\"> Finit USA</a>, responsible for parts of the data within this article. <a href=\"https://benzinga.com/apis?_gl=1&#x2A;1hlgn5i&#x2A;_ga&#x2A;MTY1NjE2NTYxMi4xNzE0NzQ4MTAy&#x2A;_ga_V7ZK73W7N0&#x2A;MTcxNDc0ODEwMi4xLjEuMTcxNDc0ODQyOC4wLjAuMA..\">Market News and Data are brought to you by Benzinga APIs</a> and include firms, like<a href=\"https://finitusa.com/en/\"> Finit USA</a>, responsible for parts of the data within this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>After Market Close UPDATE</em>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price at the time of the Power Inflow was <strong>$3200.11</strong>.

An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Dover Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1725024624_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Dover has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing Dover's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Dover's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 2.51%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T13:30:27Z", "headline": "Peering Into Dover's Recent Short Interest", "id": 40652113, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["DOV"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T13:30:27Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/short-sellers/24/08/40652113/peering-into-dovers-recent-short-interest"}

Here&#8217;s a look at a small portion of the great highlights of Buffett&#8217;s life, with one highlight for each decade the &#8220;Oracle of Omaha&#8221; lived in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1930:</strong>\u00a0Buffett was<a href=\"https://www.biography.com/business-figure/warren-buffett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u00a0born</a>\u00a0Aug.\u00a030, 1930. His father Howard was a former stockbroker. This would have a huge influence on Buffett's decision to get involved in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1940:</strong>&nbsp;Buffett <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/04/26775821/warren-buffett-life-lessons-first-stock-purchase-at-11-1\">purchased his first stock </a>at the age of 11. The purchase was for three shares of&nbsp;<strong>Cities Service Preferred</strong>, a natural gas company. Buffett bought the shares at $38 only to see them soon drop to $27 each. He waited until they hit $40 to sell for a profit. Shares later hit $200 each, which Buffett has since cited as a lesson on patience in investing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1950:</strong>\u00a0Despite his growing wealth, Buffett has\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/#1da0b5394639\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lived</a>\u00a0in the same house in Omaha, Nebraska since 1958. The home was purchased for $31,500. Adjusted for\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">inflation</a>, that would be the equivalent of over $333,192\u00a0today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1960:</strong>&nbsp;By the year 1965, Buffett had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/23/03/31279710/if-you-invested-1-000-in-berkshire-hathaway-when-warren-buffett-did-heres-how-much-youd-have-no\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">assumed control of&nbsp;</a>textiles company Berkshire Hathaway, thanks to acquiring 49%. He became a director of the company and worked on gaining full control and also diversifying the company away from textiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1970:</strong>&nbsp;Buffett became the author of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">annual Berkshire Hathaway letters</a>&nbsp;in the 1970s. These letters are considered must-reads for investors and every year, what Buffett writes to shareholders is analyzed with great detail. The letters include explanations for investments or why assets were sold. The letters also include life lessons and memorable quotes from the \"Oracle of Omaha.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1980:</strong>&nbsp;In 1988, Buffett&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/23/08/33908338/if-you-invested-1-000-in-coca-cola-stock-when-warren-buffett-did-heres-how-much-youd-have-today\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">started accumulating shares</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Coca-Cola</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/KO#NYSE\">KO</a>) for Berkshire Hathaway. After several large purchases, Berkshire Hathaway owned 7% of the company, worth $1.02 billion. Buffett has a long history with Coca-Cola, once selling bottles for a penny profit. Berkshire Hathaway still owns 400 million shares of KO, worth around $28.8&nbsp;billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1990:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Geico Insurance</strong>&nbsp;has been one of the biggest pieces for Berkshire Hathaway since it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-26-fi-39039-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired</a>&nbsp;full control in the 1990s. Berkshire completed the acquisition of the insurance company by purchasing the remaining 49% stake it didn&#8217;t previously own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buffett had been an investor in Geico shares dating back to 1951.<strong>&nbsp;Benjamin Graham,</strong>&nbsp;Buffett's mentor and professor, was once the chairman of Geico. The insurance company is forever linked to two of the most well-known investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Congress Is Making Huge Investments. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades/?utm_source=BZprocontent082924\"><strong>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2000:</strong>&nbsp;The 2000s represented a great period of fortune and giving for Buffett. In 2008, he became the richest man in the world, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/2008/03/05/buffett-worlds-richest-cx_mm_0229buffetrichest.html#278740a03180\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Forbes</a>&nbsp;valuing his wealth at $62 billion. Buffett took over the top spot from&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft</strong>&nbsp;founder<strong>&nbsp;Bill Gates</strong>, who had held the number one position for thirteen consecutive years.

Buffett has since admitted he wishes he would have bought shares earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It's probably the best business I know in the world,\" Buffett told CNBC. Berkshire bought shares of Apple again throughout the decade to make it one of the biggest pieces of its investment portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I don't think of Apple as a stock. I think of it as a third business,\" Buffett told CNBC, referring to Apple being the company's third-biggest holding behind Geico and railroad interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Berkshire Hathaway <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40165638/warren-buffetts-apple-sell-off-echoes-chevron-move-what-it-means-for-investors\">has sold some</a> of its Apple stock in recent years, the stock remains the largest holding the stock portfolio of the company with 400 million shares valued at $91.9 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2020:</strong>\u00a0Buffett imparted an investor lesson when he\u00a0<a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-sold-big-4-airlines-stocks-already-recovered-2020-5-1029237218#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sold</a> his stake in the big four airlines.

Among young adults aged 19 to 30, approximately 42% reported using cannabis in the past year, with 29% indicating past-month use and 10% engaging in daily consumption. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the midlife group aged 35 to 50, 29% reported past-year cannabis use with 19% and 8% reporting past-month and daily use, respectively. Similarly, hallucinogen use continued its upward trajectory, <strong>with 9% of young adults and 4% of midlife adults reporting use within the past year</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/05/38976556/daily-cannabis-consumption-outpaces-daily-alcohol-use-in-the-us-for-the-first-time-new-study-sho\">Daily Cannabis Consumption Outpaces Daily Alcohol Use In The US For The First Time, New Study Shows</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gen Z And Millennials Use Less And Less<strong> Tobacco And Alcohol </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the rising trend in cannabis and hallucinogen consumption, <strong>the survey found that tobacco use remained at an all-time low across both age groups</strong>. Among adults aged 19 to 30, past-month and daily alcohol continued to decline, reaching levels not seen in over a decade. The trade off is viewed by some experts as positive due to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39368875/cannabis-found-less-harmful-than-alcohol-in-new-study-where-is-the-demand-heading-investor-marke\">relatively lower harms of cannabis.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binge drinking among this age group also hit an all-time low, reflecting a broader shift away from alcohol consumption. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, among adults aged 35 to 50, binge drinking increased compared to five and ten years ago, highlighting a divergence in alcohol use patterns between younger and older adults.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vaping Shows Continued Growth</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaping, both <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/01/30267886/vaping-nicotine-most-common-substance-use-among-teens-surpassing-cannabis-booze\">nicotine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis\">cannabis</a>, continued to rise among young adults, with the 2023 survey reporting record-high levels. Nicotine vaping was reported by 25% of adults aged 19 to 30, which makes it the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/01/30267886/vaping-nicotine-most-common-substance-use-among-teens-surpassing-cannabis-booze\">most vaped substance among</a> this group. Meanwhile 22% reported cannabis vaping. For adults aged 35 to 50, the prevalence of vaping remained steady from the previous year, though long-term trends are still emerging due to the more recent addition of these questions to the survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Get Benzinga's exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

This contrasts with the midlife group, where men aged 35 to 50 continued to report higher cannabis use than women, consistent with trends observed over the past decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Public Health Implications</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Megan Patrick</strong>, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and the principal investigator of the MTF panel study, commented on the importance of these findings for public health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Alcohol continues to be the most commonly used substance across age groups, followed by cannabis and nicotine,\" Patrick noted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a recent study is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/05/38976556/daily-cannabis-consumption-outpaces-daily-alcohol-use-in-the-us-for-the-first-time-new-study-sho\">stating otherwise</a>, at least when it comes to daily use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The longer-term trends indicate that cannabis and psychedelic use have been increasing for both young adults and midlife adults, and vaping of nicotine and cannabis have increased among young adults. Some indicators of alcohol use have increased among midlife adults but decreased among young adults. Understanding these population-level patterns should inform our research and public health priorities,\" Patrick added.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39538846/colorados-youth-cannabis-use-hits-historic-lows-survey-finds\">Colorado&#8217;s Youth Marijuana Consumption Hits Historic Lows, Survey Finds</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T13:52:37Z", "headline": "Cannabis And Hallucinogen Consumption Hit All Time Highs In 2023 While Tobacco And Alcohol Declined", "id": 40652731, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/survey.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/survey.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/survey.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "2023 Monitoring the Future survey reveals sustained high levels of cannabis and hallucinogen use among U.S. adults, with trends in vaping.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T13:52:37Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40652731/cannabis-and-hallucinogen-consumption-hit-all-time-highs-in-2023-while-tobacco-and-alcohol-decli"}

{"author": "Piero Cingari", "content": "<p>The U.S. dollar strengthened across the board on Friday after newly released economic data suggested the Federal Reserve might not rush to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/large-cap/24/08/40639345/traders-scale-back-bets-on-50-basis-point-september-rate-cut-ahead-of-fridays-key-fed-inflation-ga\">implement large rate cuts.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Wall Street took comfort in data highlighting the ongoing strength of U.S. consumers, who continue to be a vital driver of economic growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, the <strong>Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index</strong>, halted its downward trend in July, though it remained below economists&#8217; expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The index held steady at a 2.5% year-over-year rate, the same as in June, slightly under the anticipated increase to 2.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When volatile items like food and energy were excluded, the core PCE Price Index also remained unchanged at 2.6% on an annual basis, missing forecasts of a rise to 2.7%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the inflation data, stronger-than-expected reports on personal income and spending further underscored the economy&#8217;s robustness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal income rose by $75.1 billion, or 0.3% month-over-month in July, surpassing both the previous and expected increases of 0.2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, government data revealed the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40627044/us-dollar-oil-prices-tech-stocks-rise-as-gdp-roars-by-3-in-q2-bonds-yen-slip-as-bets-for-large-r\">U.S. economy expanded at an upwardly revised 3%</a> annualized rate in the second quarter, a significant acceleration from the 1.4% growth in the first quarter.

{"author": "Benzinga Insights", "content": "<p><strong>ITT's</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ITT#NYSE\">ITT</a>) short percent of float has risen 4.12% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>639 thousand shares sold short</strong>, which is 1.01% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 1.23 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>ITT Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1725027321_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for ITT has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing ITT's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, ITT's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 2.53%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T14:15:24Z", "headline": "Looking Into ITT's Recent Short Interest", "id": 40653541, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["ITT"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T14:15:24Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/short-sellers/24/08/40653541/looking-into-itts-recent-short-interest"}

This shouldn't come as a huge surprise given the love for Musk from most investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question would be what a Labor Day weekend looks like for Musk, who is a known workaholic who rarely takes breaks from the companies he operates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the person hanging out with Musk, perhaps Labor Day weekend would consist of tours of the <strong>Tesla </strong>and <strong>SpaceX </strong>headquarters or a look at how social media platform <strong>X </strong>operates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing in second place was Cuban, an investor, Shark Tank member and NBA team owner. With the NBA in the offseason during Labor Day weekend, there wouldn't be the opportunity to go sit courtside at a Mavericks game or hang out with the players. The opportunity to hang out with Cuban and pick the mind of the legendary investor and NBA owner likely appealed to readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Branson ranked third and could offer the perfect Labor Day weekend for thrill seekers. Branson is known for his trip to outer space, flight in a hot-air balloon and many other risky events. A vacation with Branson could be one that a reader never forgets. Branson <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/04/20802692/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-richard-branson\">owning a private island</a> might also play into the vacation equation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gates and Bezos finished in a distant fourth and fifth place. This suggests that readers don't see as much value in hanging out with either billionaire. Perhaps readers also don't like luxury on the high seas, as a weekend vacation with Bezos could involve taking a trip on one of the most valuable superyachts in the world that<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/07/33109849/operating-bezos-superyacht-costs-25-million-a-year-could-fianc-es-piloting-skills-offset-expenses\"> costs $25 million annually</a> to operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Congress Is Making Huge Investments. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades/?utm_source=BZprocontent082924\"><strong>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong> While the reader poll is purely hypothetical, it could illustrate which billionaires are most trusted by investors and who is viewed as offering valuable advice going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk also ranked first in a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/07/39695004/elon-musk-warren-buffett-nancy-pelosi-jensen-huang-michael-saylor-who-you-sitting-by-on-a-p\">social media poll</a> asking who a person would rather sit by on a 10-hour flight, with a seat next to Musk and <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> getting 45% of the vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40423891/buffett-musk-wood-cuban-or-ackman-who-do-investors-trust-most-with-life-savings-poll-shows-it-isnt-e\">recent Benzinga poll </a>found Musk and Cuban tied for second for who readers would most trust with investing their life savings. <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> ranked first in that poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check This Out:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades/?utm_source=BZprocontent082924\"><strong>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The study was conducted by Benzinga Aug. 26 through Aug. 27, 2024, and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.

This significant decline underscores growing investor concerns over prolonged regulatory uncertainty, which could hinder the company's expansion efforts in the U.S., a key market for its future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DEA's delayed decision has dampened market expectations, especially for companies like Canopy Growth that were relying on a favorable rescheduling outcome to strengthen their U.S. market position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the decision now postponed indefinitely, investors are becoming more cautious about potential regulatory obstacles that could impede the company's growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40419783/canopy-growth-ceo-departure-leaves-nasdaq-listed-company-poised-for-profit-surge-what-investors-\">Canopy Growth CEO Departure Leaves Nasdaq-Listed Company Poised For Profit Surge \u2013 What Investors Need To Know</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Else:</strong> Political uncertainty continues to heighten market volatility. <strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong>, a staunch advocate for cannabis reform, has been viewed as a pivotal figure in pushing for federal legalization. However, the potential re-election of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> presents a contrasting outlook, as his vice-presidential candidate opposes cannabis legalization. This uncertainty creates a challenging landscape for cannabis stocks, contributing to investor anxiety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canopy Growth has been strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the U.S. market through partnerships and acquisitions. However, delays from the DEA complicate these efforts, potentially hindering the company's ability to enter the U.S. market under favorable regulatory conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This uncertainty could slow Canopy's expansion plans, putting pressure on its revenue growth and profitability in the near term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the delay may impact Canopy Growth&#8217;s ability to secure additional financing or investments, as regulatory ambiguity may deter investors seeking more clarity on the U.S. market's legal landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40613739/dea-schedules-hearing-on-proposed-ban-of-psychedelics-doi-doc-amid-researchers-concerns\">DEA Schedules Hearing On Proposed Ban Of Psychedelic Compounds With Therapeutic Potential</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Buy CGC Stock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Canopy Growth &#8211; be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-stock-trading-platforms\">possible trading platforms here.</a> Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, or Amazon.com, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the the case of Canopy Growth, which is trading at $5.16 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 19.38 shares of stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data from\u00a0<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro</a>, CGC has a 52-week high of $19.20 and a 52-week low of $2.76.</p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T14:37:48Z", "headline": "Why Canopy Growth (CGC) Stock Is Down 15% This Week", "id": 40654148, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/analysis-4937349.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/analysis-4937349.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/analysis-4937349.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Canopy Growth&#39;s shares fell by 15.8% this week after the DEA delayed its decision on rescheduling cannabis.

Looking at Affirm, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line.

{"author": "RIPS", "content": "<p>Good Morning Traders! In today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#39;s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#39;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SPY is currently trading near our key level of 560.83. For a bullish scenario, we&rsquo;d like to see the price push higher initially to 561.90. If the price action maintains strength above 561.90, we&rsquo;re looking for buyers to drive the price up to our next target at 563.23. Should this level hold during regular trading hours, a further push could see the price testing 564.29. The highest bull target for SPY today is set at 565.38.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the downside, if 560.83 fails to hold as support, we expect the bears to challenge the 559.75 level. Should sellers take control here, a move lower toward 558.32 is likely. A break below this point under significant selling pressure would lead to a test of the strong support at 557.44. If the selling intensifies, our lowest bear target for today is at 556.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>QQQ is currently trading near our critical level of 474.66. For the bulls to gain momentum, we need to see buyers establish support above this level. If 474.66 holds firm, the next upside target is 476.85, which, if claimed, could pave the way for a move toward 479.03. Should the buying pressure continue, the price could rise further to test the 481.73 level. The highest bull target for QQQ today is positioned at 483.95.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, if 474.66 fails to act as support, the bears might push the price down to 471.33. If selling pressure persists, we could see a move toward the next support level at 469.27. A break below this could bring the price down to 467.60. Should the bearish momentum intensify, the low bear target for QQQ today is set at 465.93.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apple Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple is currently trading around the 230.25 level. For the bulls, maintaining support at this level is crucial. If 230.25 holds, we&rsquo;re looking for the price to move higher toward 231.76. Continued buying could drive the price up to 233.28. If the bullish momentum remains strong, a push to our high bull target at 234.20 is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the 230.25 level fails to hold, we anticipate a test of the 229.03 support. Continued selling pressure could lead the price down to 227.82. If this level is broken, the next downside target is 226.90. Should the selling continue, the low bear target for the day is 226.08.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Microsoft Corp. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft is currently trading near our key level of 416.32. For the bulls, the goal is to maintain support above this level and push higher toward 417.25. If the price holds above 417.25 during regular trading hours, it could rally further to 419.17. Continued bullish activity might see the price reach our high bull target for the day at 420.26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the 416.32 level doesn&rsquo;t hold, the bears may target the 414.56 level. If selling pressure continues, we could see a further decline toward 413.14. A break below this level would likely lead to a test of 411.72. Should the bearish momentum persist, the low bear target for Microsoft today is 410.64.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>NVIDIA Corporation </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NVIDIA is currently trading near our critical level of 119.44. For a bullish scenario, we need to see the price push higher to 120.27 and establish this as a new support. If the bulls can maintain control, we could see the price move up to 121.97. A strong rally could push the price further to 123.41, with the high bull target for NVIDIA today set at 125.21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the 119.44 level fails to hold, we&rsquo;re likely to see the bears test the 117.86 level. Should sellers take control here, a move down to 116.61 is expected. Continued selling could bring the price down to 115.83. If the bearish momentum continues, the low bear target for NVIDIA today is at 115.15.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alphabet is currently trading around our key level of 163.79. For the bulls, holding this level as support is crucial for a move higher. If 163.79 holds, we&rsquo;re looking for the price to climb to 165.41. Continued bullish momentum could drive the price up to our high bull target for the day at 167.04.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if 163.79 fails to hold as support, we expect the bears to push the price down to 161.79. A break below this level could lead to a test of 160.36. If the selling pressure increases, the low bear target for Alphabet today is set at 158.54.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta is currently trading near our key level of 520.27. For the bulls, holding above this level is essential. If 520.27 acts as a solid support, we could see the price move higher to 526.29. Continued buying could drive the price up to 531.03. If the bullish momentum remains strong, the high bull target for Meta today is set at 534.33.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 520.27 fails to hold, the bears might push the price down to 515.39. If selling pressure persists, we could see a move toward the next support level at 512.85. A break below this could bring the price down to 508.25, which is the low bear target for Meta today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tesla Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla is currently trading around our key level of 209.51. For a bullish scenario, we&rsquo;d like to see the price push higher to 211.53. If the buying continues, we could see a rally up to 213.88. Should the broader market rally today, Tesla might test the 216.31 level. If the buying pressure is strong, the high bull target for Tesla today is 217.78.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 209.51 doesn&rsquo;t hold, the bears might push the price down to 206.71. Continued selling could lead to a test of 204.33. If this level is breached, we expect the price to drop to our low bear target for the day at 201.85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Word: As we approach the end of the week, today&rsquo;s trading session is set to be particularly impactful, with a series of key economic data releases that could significantly influence market direction. The day begins with the release of the PCE Price Index for July at 8:30 AM ET, a critical measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve closely monitors. Alongside this, we&rsquo;ll also see the Personal Income and Real Personal Spending figures for July, both of which provide insights into the consumer&rsquo;s financial health and spending habits, key components in assessing the overall strength of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 9:45 AM ET, the Chicago PMI for August will be released, offering an important gauge of manufacturing activity in one of the country&rsquo;s major industrial hubs. This report will be scrutinized for any signs of economic slowdown or resilience within the manufacturing sector. Shortly after, at 10 AM ET, the market will turn its attention to the Final University of Michigan Sentiment reading for August. This report, along with the 1-Year and 5-10 Year Inflation outlook, will provide critical insights into consumer confidence and inflation expectations, which are vital for forecasting future economic conditions and potential Fed actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The significance of these reports cannot be overstated, as they will collectively offer a comprehensive view of the current economic landscape, influencing both short-term market sentiment and longer-term investment strategies. Given that today is the final trading session of August, we may see increased volatility as traders position themselves ahead of the new month. This could lead to sharp price movements, especially in response to unexpected data outcomes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders should approach today&rsquo;s session with heightened caution, being mindful of the potential for rapid market shifts. It&rsquo;s essential to stay nimble, manage risk effectively, and be prepared to adjust strategies on the fly. With multiple data points in play, the market could react in unpredictable ways, so maintaining a disciplined approach will be key to navigating the session successfully.

{"author": "Juan Sp\u00ednelli", "content": "<p><strong>Minnesota Nice Ethnobotanicals</strong>, a company dedicated to offering high-quality, ethically sourced botanical products officially launched as the largest vertically integrated ethnobotanical company in the United States. This announcement marks a significant development in the growing field of plant-based remedies, as the company sets its sights on dominating both the retail and wholesale markets across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a particular focus on <strong><a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/amanita-muscaria/\">Amanita Muscaria</a></strong>, the iconic red and white-spotted mushroom, Minnesota Nice has established itself as a niche player in the market, appealing to enthusiasts and newcomers alike. However, the company's product range extends far beyond mushrooms, encompassing a diverse array of botanical herbs such as Blue Lotus, Kava, and Kanna. These products, available in various forms including extracts, gummies, chocolates and muscle creams, are crafted to enhance their natural benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Riding The Ethnobotanical Wave</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise of Minnesota Nice Ethnobotanicals comes at a time when <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/psychedelics\">psychedelics and ethnobotanicals</a> are gaining attention in the wellness and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/psychedelic-assisted-therapies\">mental health</a> sectors. These natural remedies, rooted in traditional cultural practices, are increasingly viewed as viable alternatives to conventional pharmaceuticals, particularly for conditions like <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/ptsd\">depression</a> and anxiety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christian Rasmussen</strong>, the founder and CEO, says the renewed interest in ethnobotanicals like Amanita Muscaria &#8211; also known as Fly Agaric &#8211; is a direct response to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39381895/17-us-veterans-take-their-own-lives-everyday-heres-how-one-cannabis-company-is-trying-to-help\">mental health crisis</a> gripping many Americans. \"Most people associate Amanita Muscaria with Mario and Luigi,\" Rasmussen told Benzinga, referring to the mushroom's appearance in popular culture. \"They know it when they see it but they don't know the mushroom's real name, let alone all the benefits that come with it. Amanita Muscaria's uses are slowly beginning to be rediscovered and I think it's a direct result of the mental health crisis Americans are facing.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal Journey Fuels A Business Vision</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen's journey into the world of ethnobotanicals was sparked by a personal struggle with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Finding relief through Amanita Muscaria, Rasmussen was inspired to create a company that offers natural alternatives to synthetic, lab-created remedies. His experience underscores the growing interest in ethnobotanicals as a means to address modern-day maladies through ancient, plant-based solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I was inspired by my experience with Amanita Muscaria to create an avenue for anyone seeking alternatives to common remedies that are usually synthetic and created in a lab,\" Rasmussen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Seeking Accessibility And Outreach</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen told Benzinga that the company's mission is not just to sell products but to educate consumers about the benefits and uses of ethnobotanicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minnesota Nice Ethnobotanicals are available in a variety of ingestible options including powders, capsules, dried flowers and gummies. Offerings range from affordable options starting at $8 to premium products exceeding $1,000. All products are available for purchase online, making them accessible to customers nationwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cover image made with AI</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T15:06:33Z", "headline": "Minnesota Nice Ethnobotanicals Launches, Largest In US Focused On Amanita Muscaria", "id": 40655155, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/3-4.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/3-4.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/3-4.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Minnesota Nice Ethnobotanicals, the U.S.&#39;s largest vertically integrated ethnobotanical company, offers plant-based wellness solutions.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T15:06:33Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40655155/minnesota-nice-ethnobotanicals-launches-largest-in-us-focused-on-amanita-muscaria"}

{"author": "Murtuza Merchant", "content": "<p><strong>Ethereum </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>) co-founder <strong>Vitalik

The ruling asserts that disarming Connelly based on her past marijuana use violates her Second Amendment rights, a stance backed by a 2022 Supreme Court decision that broadened gun ownership protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Marijuana user or not, Paola is a member of our political community and thus has a presumptive right to bear arms,&#8221; wrote <strong>U.S. Circuit Judge Kurt Engelhardt</strong>, underscoring that the disqualification of sober individuals from gun ownership lacks historical basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Get Benzinga&#8217;s exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

The bulk of this revenue growth comes from strong sales of Nvidia&#39;s Hopper GPU, which have significantly boosted the company&#39;s profitability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, Nvidia reported a gross profit margin of 75.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, beating the expected $0.64. However, despite these strong financial results, Nvidia&rsquo;s stock dropped by 6% in after-hours trading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This decline likely reflects the market&#39;s high expectations before the earnings release rather than any issues with the company&#39;s performance. Adding to investor interest, Nvidia&#39;s CFO, Colette Kress, announced plans to launch the much-anticipated Blackwell chip in the fourth quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company expects this next-generation chip to bring in several billion dollars in additional revenue, highlighting Nvidia&rsquo;s leadership in the AI chip market. With a dominant 90% market share, Nvidia continues to lead the tech industry&#39;s move towards advanced AI infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a demanding work environment with late nights and weekend shifts, Nvidia has a low employee turnover rate compared to the broader semiconductor industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is largely due to the significant financial benefits of stock ownership. Since 2019, Nvidia&#39;s stock has increased by over 3,000%, turning many employees into millionaires and discouraging them from leaving before their stock grants fully vest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CEO Jensen Huang has openly stated that achieving exceptional results at Nvidia is challenging, reflecting the company&#39;s high-performance culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the technical side, Nvidia&#39;s stock shows potential to bounce back despite recent drops. The $100 level could act as a psychological support point, having previously helped the stock recover in early August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2024-08-29_18-47-04.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u517520/2024-08-29_18-47-04.jpg\" style=\"height:308px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the daily 200 simple moving average around $90 adds another solid support layer, indicating limited downside for the stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Nvidia&#39;s stock is currently having trouble breaking past the June high of $140, the strong support levels below should prevent major declines and might spark a return of the bullish momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the closing bell on Wednesday, August 28, the stock closed at $125.61, trading down by 2.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

Users can store proof of COVID-19 tests or documentation of having recovered from the virus, along with other health-related forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Airlines had been testing the app from its hub at Miami International Airport and will now provide it as an option for travelers departing from all of its domestic airports for direct and connecting flights to eight countries: United Kingdom, Canada, Jamaica, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/More-Access-More-Ease-American-Airlines-Expands-its-Acceptance-of-VeriFLY-App-at-All-Airports-OPS-DIS-02/default.aspx\">American Airlines</a> said its joint business partner, British Airways, which is part of <strong>International Consolidated Airlns Grp SA</strong> (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BABWF#OTC\">BABWF</a>),&nbsp;will be testing the VeriFLY app&nbsp;for passengers flying from London to the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company said this marks the first time that two airlines in a trans-Atlantic joint business alliance will accept a common mobile health passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are constantly looking at ways to make travel easier and simpler for our customers, and navigating testing requirements and validation is a big piece of that,&quot;&nbsp;Julie Rath, vice president of customer experience at American Airlines, said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app will &quot;further our common goal of preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensure compliance with local regulations that have been put in place to protect our customers and team members,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Alaska Is Using VeriFLY:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.alaskaair.com/2021-02-04-Alaska-Airlines-offers-international-fliers-VeriFLY-mobile-health-passport-for-required-COVID-docs\">Alaska Airlines</a>, a subsidiary of the Alaska Air Group, is also making the VeriFLY app available for international travelers arriving in the U.S. on its airplanes. Passengers must present their certified VeriFLY profile to an Alaska Airlines agent, which is their first point of contact upon arrival, according to the airline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the guest&#39;s information is validated, the guest can continue normal check-in without additional test verification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VeriFLY&nbsp;is owned by Doan, a privately held software company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&#39;s Next:</strong> VeriFLY app use is not mandatory, but is being encouraged to help speed the passenger processing times at&nbsp;airports. Nor is it the only app of its kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar digital health wallet is being developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which plans to conduct a trial with Panama&#39;s Copa Airlines next month for travel within Latin America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This app, called the IATA Travel Pass, is also being considered by Qatar Airways, and United Arab Emirates&#39;&nbsp;Etihad&nbsp;and Emirates airways.

{"author": "Upwallstreet", "content": "<p>On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) issued a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter report. However, its shares fell after the report, but still remain about 150% up for the year&nbsp;as Nvidia continues to serve big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\">MSFT</a>), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>)&nbsp;Alphabet (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ\">GOOG</a>)(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\">GOOGL</a>), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Second Quarter Highlights</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the quarter ended in July, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 122% on a YoY basis as it topped $30 billion. After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of 64 cents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter&rsquo;s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year&rsquo;s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia&rsquo;s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business&nbsp;reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Third Quarter Guidance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount&rsquo;s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of&nbsp;strong Hopper&nbsp;demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delay of Blackwell chip rollout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it&nbsp;in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia&rsquo;s efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) on the list of the world&rsquo;s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and&nbsp;Meta&nbsp;being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis.&nbsp;Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia&rsquo;s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMD#NASDAQ\">AMD</a>) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<em>DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The company continued to lose market share in prestige, \"largely driven by pressure in makeup and hair,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Factors driving the decline in comp store transactions include normalization in the beauty category and an increasingly value-focused consumer, competitive intensity in the category, operational disruption from the completion of the company's ERP transition, and incremental promotions, which did not deliver the expected sales lift in stores,\" the analyst wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stifel On Ulta Beauty</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/585aa876b5a482000151d0ec/mark-astrachan\">Analyst <strong>Mark Astrachan</strong></a> reiterated a Hold rating while cutting the price target from $475 to $385.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ulta Beauty reported disappointing quarterly results, with EBIT of $329 million missing consensus of $344 million and weaker-than-forecast comp, which were down 1.2% versus expectations of 1.4% growth, Astrachan said. The company reduced its full-year guidance \"across key metrics,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company's comp trends weakened through the second quarter, even with increased promotions, suggesting the \"magnitude of challenges\" it faces, the analyst stated. \"Comp weakness reflects ongoing modest U.S. beauty category growth and most notably share loss, especially in prestige (hair and makeup) as competition (distribution points and promotions) pressures trends,\" he further wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings\">other analyst stock ratings</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BMO Capital Markets On Ulta Beauty</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/583f220faae83900016b3aee/simeon-siegel\">Analyst<strong> Simeon Siege</strong></a> maintained a Market Perform rating while slashing the price target from $500 to $385.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ulta Beauty's revenues came in at around $2.552 billion, missing consensus of $2.612 billion, with a 1.2% decline comp, Siege said. \"Sales decelerated throughout 2Q, with July the most challenged, though Digital accelerated throughout 2Q,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although management expects the trends witnessed in the first half to continue in the second half of the year, the 100 basis point (bps) change in EBIT margin \"is largely a result of fixed cost deleverage on the worse-than-originally-expected sales trends,\" the analyst wrote. The company's inventory continued to grow, rising 10.1% year-on-year and 4.8% sequentially, he further stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Piper Sandler On Ulta Beauty</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/625eb91472b50e0001b1f6b5/korinne-wolfmeyer\">Analyst </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/625eb91472b50e0001b1f6b5/korinne-wolfmeyer\">Korinne Wolfmeyer</a> </strong>reaffirmed a Neutral rating while reducing the price target from $404 to $356.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ulta Beauty's same-store sales decline is expected to continue in the fiscal third and fourth quarters, \"with spending trends worsening throughout the quarter,\" Wolfmeyer said. Although trends did improve in August, \"the midpoint of the guidance still implies overall deceleration,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\"Management&#8217;s commentary around efforts to re-accelerate the business were encouraging, but we&#8217;re not out of the woods with competitive rollout and the macro, and incremental promo tactics are not proving as effective yet,\" the analyst wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>JPMorgan On Ulta Beauty</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/586bcbd9351b9b0001ab738c/matthew-boss\">Analyst Christopher Horvers</a> reiterated an Overweight rating and price target of $450.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company's second-quarter comp declined by 1.2% and gross margins contracted by 100 bps, Horvers said.

You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, PJT Partners's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.14%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T16:30:23Z", "headline": "How Is The Market Feeling About PJT Partners?", "id": 40657260, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["PJT"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T16:30:24Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/short-sellers/24/08/40657260/how-is-the-market-feeling-about-pjt-partners"}

Management lowered their full-year earnings guidance by around 18% to $5.55-$6.20 per share, he further stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Truist Securities</strong>: The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company reduced its outlook by nearly 20%. \"We believe its core lower-income consumer remains under material stress (running out of $ by month-end),\" Ciccarelli said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company may also be losing market share to <strong>Walmart Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WMT#NYSE\">WMT</a>) with traffic slowing. That&#8217;s \"the opposite of what has historically happened in times of consumer stress,\" the analyst added. Margins could \"continue to be pressured by price and labor investments and mix, although shrink could improve in 4Q24/25.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BMO Capital Markets</strong>: Plans for increased promotional activity \"predominately in traffic-driving categories\" in the back half of the year also impacted Dollar General's full-year guidance, Bania added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We continue to believe that DG&#8217;s evergreen inventory strategy is proving to be a greater-than-expected headwind,\" the analyst wrote. While inventory was down 7% year-on-year, it needs to decline by 17% to reach historical inventory and sales levels, putting into question \"the quality &amp; freshness of inventory at this stage,\" the analyst stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>: The company same-store sales deteriorated sequentially, mainly due to \"pressures on the lowest income consumer, price competition and lack of discretionary growth,\" McShane said. Dollar General's margins also missed expectations and could remain under pressure as the company spends on promotions to drive demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the reduction in guidance was \"highly unexpected,\" the stock reaction seems \"overdone,\" the analyst state. \"We were encouraged with traffic trends still in the positive range and think the promotional strategies the company started to push in late July/early August have yielded better unit growth,\" he further wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Telsey Advisory Group</strong>: Dollar General's operating margins contracted by 168 basis points (bps) to 5.4% and missed the consensus of 5.6%, Feldman said. This reflected gross margin compression of 112 bps to 30%, \"given higher markdowns, inventory damages, and shrink, as well as an unfavorable product mix shift toward consumables,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Given tough consumer spending trends and related gross margin pressures, the company cut its 2024 EPS guidance to $5.50-$6.20 from $6.80-$7.55,\" the analyst wrote. The reduction was on account of a cut in the sales growth outlook to 4.7%-5.3%, from the previous projection of 6.0%-6.7%, he further stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DG Price Action:</strong> Shares of Dollar General<strong> </strong>had risen by 2.84% to $86.42 at the time of publication on Friday after losing 9.2% in Thursday&#8217;s session. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40652826/dollar-surges-as-doubts-over-aggressive-rate-cuts-grow-wall-street-climbs-on-consumer-strength-7\">Dollar Surges As Doubts Over Aggressive Rate Cuts Grow, Wall Street Climbs On Consumer Strength: 7 ETFs React To Fed&#8217;s Inflation Data</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T16:31:17Z", "headline": "Dollar General Market Share Loss To Walmart Is 'Opposite Of What Historically Happens' When Consumers Stress: Analyst (UPDATED)", "id": 40656935, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/dollar-general-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/dollar-general-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/dollar-general-shutter.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Dollar General reports Q2 earnings miss and reduces its outlook by 20%.

{"author": "Juan Sp\u00ednelli", "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mike-tyson\">Mike Tyson</a>, the legendary heavyweight boxing champ, is once again in the spotlight not for his wild antics in the ring, but for his unconventional training regimen involving <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/magic-mushrooms\">psychedelic mushrooms</a>. As USA Today <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2024/08/29/mike-tyson-psychedelics-mushrooms-athlete-training/74969058007/\">reported</a>, during a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6nn1sravFI&amp;t=633s\">appearance</a> on Logan Paul&#8217;s podcast, Tyson revealed that he consumes mushrooms while training for his upcoming fight against Jake Paul on November 15. &#8220;It takes me to heaven, baby,&#8221; Tyson exclaimed, adding yet another layer to his complex persona.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Athletes Turning To Psilocybin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson isn't alone in his exploration of psychedelics. A growing number of athletes across various sports have begun incorporating <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/psilocybin\">psilocybin</a>, the active compound in &#8220;magic mushrooms,&#8221; into their training routines. These athletes, including professional hockey players, golfers and MMA fighters are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/microdosing\">microdosing</a>\u2014taking small amounts of the drug that do not produce a psychoactive effect but are believed to increase focus and aid recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Ara Suppiah</strong>, a physician with experience working with Ryder Cup teams, estimates that 4% to 5% of professional golfers are microdosing mushrooms. &#8220;It makes you feel much more present,&#8221; Suppiah said, although he declined to name specific golfers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, retired NHL player <strong>Riley Cote</strong>, who has advocated for psilocybin&#8217;s benefits in managing the long-term effects of concussions, shared that at least a dozen active NHL players are microdosing. Cote, who played as an enforcer for the Philadelphia Flyers, said the benefits extend beyond sports. &#8220;This is not even about just the hockey performance or sports performance, it&#8217;s just life performance,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mushrooms In MMA And Beyond</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The practice has also gained traction in the world of mixed martial arts (MMA). <strong>Rashad Evans</strong>, a former UFC light heavyweight champion, disclosed that he knows at least 30 UFC fighters who regularly microdose. Evans himself used mushrooms while training for his last fight in 2022, crediting the them with reducing soreness and aiding recovery. &#8220;The next day I feel totally rebooted and ready to do it again,&#8221; Evans said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ian McCall</strong>, another retired MMA fighter, has worked with fighters using psilocybin for the past five years, but noted that the practice only gained widespread attention in the last two years. One of his clients, <strong>Mark Irwin</strong>, a bare-knuckle brawler, has even competed while under the influence of a significant dose of mushrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Influence Of Tyson</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the use of psychedelics in sports has been growing quietly, it was Tyson's openness about his usage that catapulted the topic into mainstream conversation. Tyson has credited psychedelics with helping him turn his life around, lose 100 pounds and improve his relationships. He also attributes his return to boxing to the mental clarity and focus provided by mushrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Bramlage</strong>, a specialist in microdosing who works with several NHL players, discussed the psychological benefits. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s Mike Tyson or it&#8217;s my NHL athletes, they get into a flow state where they&#8217;re no longer thinking about what they have to do later or what they did yesterday or the stressors of their life,&#8221; Bramlage told to USA Today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks And Future Of Psychedelics In Sports</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its growing popularity, psilocybin remains a Schedule I substance under <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/controlled-substances-act\">federal law,</a> making it illegal. However, states like Oregon and Colorado have legalized its supervised use, and there is a push for broader legalization. The <strong>World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)</strong> does not list psilocybin as a prohibited substance, but this could change if it is deemed to provide an unfair advantage. &#8220;The only question I have is are they going to look at it and say, is this an unfair advantage?&#8221; Suppiah pondered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some athletes tout the benefits, the National Institute on Drug Abuse warns of potential health risks, including increased heart rate, nausea and paranoia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of TYSON 2.0</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T16:42:50Z", "headline": "Mike Tyson Sparks Psychedelic Buzz: Athletes Embrace Magic Mushrooms To Increase Focus And Recovery", "id": 40657551, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/unnamed-11.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/unnamed-11.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/unnamed-11.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Mike Tyson sparks a trend as more athletes turn to magic mushrooms, raising questions about the role of psychedelics in sports.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T16:42:51Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40657551/mike-tyson-sparks-psychedelic-buzz-athletes-embrace-magic-mushrooms-to-increase-focus-and-recove"}

For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FCUV Price Action:</strong> According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/?gspk=YWRhbWVja2VydDUzMzY&amp;gsxid=zBMR4PKmcgBw\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Focus Universal shares are up 112% at 40 cents at the time of publication Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40640482/whats-going-on-with-brenmiller-energy-stock-after-earnings\"><strong>What&#8217;s Going On With Brenmiller Energy Stock After Earnings?</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T16:53:15Z", "headline": "Why Focus Universal Stock Is Up Today", "id": 40657735, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/reports-earnings.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/reports-earnings.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/reports-earnings.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Focus Universal Inc.

As a result, Lego is now focused on gradually reducing the oil content in its bricks by purchasing certified renewable resin, which can cost up to 70% more than traditional materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citing CEO <strong>Niels Christiansen, </strong>Reuters noted that this approach significantly increases the cost of producing each Lego brick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2026, Lego aims to have more than half of its required resin certified through the mass balance method, an auditable system that tracks sustainable materials throughout the supply chain. This would mark a significant jump from the 30% achieved in the first half of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christiansen emphasized that Lego&#8217;s efforts come despite a surplus of cheap virgin plastic, largely due to major oil companies&#8217; investments in petrochemicals, which are expected to drive new oil demand for decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lego&#8217;s suppliers are utilizing bio-waste, such as cooking oil and food industry waste fat, along with recycled materials, to replace virgin fossil fuels in plastic production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the market for recycled or renewable plastic remains in its early stages, with much of the available feedstock diverted to subsidized biodiesel for transportation fuels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Neste OYJ </strong>(OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NTOIF#OTC\">NTOIF</a>) (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NTOIY#OTC\">NTOIY</a>), the world&#8217;s largest producer of renewable feedstocks, reports that fossil-based plastic is still about half or a third of the cost of sustainable alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, competitors like <strong>Hasbro Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HAS#NASDAQ\">HAS</a>) and <strong>Mattel Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MAT#NASDAQ\">MAT</a>) are also exploring more sustainable materials.

Looking at Airship AI Holdings, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Airship AI Holdings, the 200-day moving average sits at $5.22, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, which is above the current price of $3.09. For more on charts and trend lines, <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">see a description here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal.

{"author": "Vandana Singh", "content": "<p>U.S. District Judge <strong>Karen Marston</strong> of Philadelphia recently issued a pivotal ruling in a closely watched multidistrict litigation (MDL) involving diabetes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/23/10/35123873/novo-nordisks-weight-loss-drugs-like-wegovy-ozempic-may-pose-serious-stomach-risks-study-suggests\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">and weight-loss drugs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The litigation focuses on alleged side effects of medications such as <strong>Ozempic</strong>, <strong>Wegovy</strong>, and <strong>Mounjaro</strong>, developed by <strong>Novo Nordisk</strong> A/S (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVO#NYSE\">NVO</a>) and <strong>Eli Lilly And Co</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LLY#NYSE\">LLY</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/08/40550961/novo-nordisk-does-not-operate-as-drug-cartel-ceo-defends-us-pricing-of-ozempic-against-criticism-\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Novo Nordisk Does Not Operate As Drug Cartel, CEO Defends US Pricing Of Ozempic Against Criticism Over High Drug Prices</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ruling centers on the defendants&#8217; request to address several key legal questions at the outset of the case, which could potentially streamline or even halt the litigation before it gains momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reuters highlights that the plaintiffs in the MDL allege that these medications caused gastroparesis, a condition where the stomach&#8217;s ability to pass food to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/large-cap/23/07/33377570/novo-nordisks-ozempic-and-wegovy-under-scrutiny-amid-reports-of-stomach-paralysis\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">small intestines slows or stops</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plaintiffs claim that the drug labels did not adequately warn of this risk. However, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly contend that their labels disclose gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and vomiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They argue that if plaintiffs cannot definitively prove they suffer from gastroparesis rather than other gastrointestinal issues, their claims should be pre-empted by the existing warnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The judge emphasized that these legal questions could be resolved without hearing from individual plaintiffs. This ruling could significantly impact the trajectory of the case, especially if it leads to dismissing claims or narrowing the issues to be litigated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers argued that it is premature to address these questions without a full factual record from bellwether trials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They expressed concern that Marston&#8217;s early rulings might set a precedent that limits plaintiffs&#8217; ability to present individual circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Eli Lilly spokesperson welcomed the ruling, stating that it would &#8220;accelerate resolution&#8221; of what the company views as meritless lawsuits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the case progresses, legal experts will be closely watching to see how this unusual approach influences the outcome, potentially setting a new standard for future MDLs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong><em> This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/08/40649541/mpox-vaccine-emergent-biosolutions-smallpox-vaccine-gets-fda-nod-for-expanded-use-for-individuals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mpox Vaccine: Emergent BioSolutions&#8217; Smallpox Vaccine Gets FDA Nod For Expanded Use For Individuals At High Risk Of Mpox Infection</a>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image By Natalia Varlei On Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T17:38:20Z", "headline": "Judge's Early Ruling May Shape Outcome In Ozempic, Wegovy Lawsuits", "id": 40658828, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/10-Celebrities-Open-Up-About-Their-Ozemp.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/10-Celebrities-Open-Up-About-Their-Ozemp.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/10-Celebrities-Open-Up-About-Their-Ozemp.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "A Philadelphia judge&#39;s early ruling in the Ozempic and Wegovy litigation may shape the outcome of the lawsuits against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, focusing on the diagnosis of gastroparesis and the adequacy of drug warnings.", "symbols": ["LLY", "NVO"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T17:38:21Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/08/40658828/judges-early-ruling-may-shape-outcome-in-ozempic-wegovy-lawsuits"}

{"author": "Mark Putrino", "content": "<p>Sometimes a support or resistance level can retain their importance for a long time. It could be days, weeks, months or even years. Traders refer to this as market memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see on the following chart, this is the case with the $84.50 level for shares of<strong> Dollar Tree Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DLTR#NASDAQ\">DLTR</a>). This level has been important for years. This is why our team of trading experts has made it our <strong>&#8220;Stock of the Day.&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock found support there in September 2020. Then it reversed and rallied. One year later in September 2021, it found support there again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stocks tend to find support at levels that had previously been support because of seller's remorse. Some people who sold while the shares were at the support regret their decision to do so if the price moves higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the stock eventually reverses and goes down to their selling price, a number of these remorseful sellers can decide to buy their shares back.

These buyers know anyone looking to sell will go to whoever is willing to pay the highest price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don't want to miss the trade, so they increase the prices they are willing to pay.

{"author": "Anusuya Lahiri", "content": "<p><strong>MongoDB, Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MDB#NASDAQ\">MDB</a>)&nbsp;stock climbed on<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Friday after the company reported&nbsp;upbeat&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40639636/mongodb-stock-rallies-after-strong-q2-results-upbeat-guidance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">second-quarter earnings</a>&nbsp;on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company reported quarterly sales of $478.1 million, up 12.8% year-on-year. It topped analyst consensus estimates of $464 million. The quarterly earnings of 70 cents per share beat the analyst consensus estimate of 49 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results came amid an&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/earnings\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">exciting earnings season</a>. Here are some key analyst takeaways.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria reiterated MongoDB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MDB/analyst-ratings\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with an Outperform</a> and a $350&nbsp;price target.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Buy and raised the price target from&nbsp;$300&nbsp;to&nbsp;$325.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Truist Securities analyst Miller Jump reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from&nbsp;$300&nbsp;to&nbsp;$320.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin maintained an Overweight and raised the price target from&nbsp;$300&nbsp;to&nbsp;$335.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Goldman Sachs analyst&nbsp;Kash Rangan&nbsp;reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $340.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>JMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens maintained an Outperform rating and a $350 price target.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RBC Capital:</strong> MongoDB reported a good beat-and-raise quarter, leading shares up 13% after market close, Jaluria noted. Atlas&#8217; revenue was solid. Margins and EPS upside were solid, and Jaluria raised his estimates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, the analyst flagged that consumption trends improved, operational headwinds subsided, and new business generation was strong. Jaluria noted that the second quarter was a good outcome, and fiscal 2025 is back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering MongoDB&#8217;s large TAM, powerful secular drivers, and category leadership, the price target implies a premium to the peer group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaluria expects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $495 million and 66 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stifel:</strong> MongoDB posted a solid rebound quarter. A 3% revenue beat was driven by consumption growth that modestly outperformed expectations and solid improvement in new business execution across Enterprise Advanced and Atlas, sending the stock up ~14% after hours after being down ~40% year-to-date, Reback noted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst said results highlight improving execution in the challenged macro, which, combined with investments that should support gross margin expansion and an expanding set of core and emerging growth drivers, should enable the company to sustain 20%+ revenue growth and incremental levels of profitability and cash flow in coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reback expects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $496.1 million and 68 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Truist Securities:</strong> MongoDB produced second-quarter results that indicated some stabilization in the business after a shaky start to the year, Jump noted. From an execution perspective, the management team pointed to an improvement in new business as a sign of their operational rebound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a macro perspective, consumption patterns in the quarter uptick slightly from the first quarter but are not enough to change the company&#8217;s expectations for the remainder of the year. Jump expects the company to reaccelerate revenue growth by about 17% annually and scale to a 23% free cash flow margin by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jump expects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $495 million and 68 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Piper Sandler: </strong>The solid beat-and-raise suggests the worst of a two-year growth moderation is now behind MongoDB, Bracelin noted. The second-quarter top-line growth could mark a near-term quarterly trough, setting up for accelerating growth into next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bracelin<strong> </strong>expects further growth normalization back above the 20%+ range exiting next year, even with little benefit from artificial intelligence, another upside lever. The analyst adds that MongoDB remains a high-quality and profitable growth compounder with a modern cloud database facing favorable secular tailwinds that could help double revenue to $4 billion-$5 billion in three to five years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solid execution, as evident by the quarterly beat-and-raise and underlying Atlas momentum, further increases Bracelin&#8217;s conviction that growth investors rebuild core positions in MongoDB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bracelin expects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $495.2 million and 68 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goldman Sachs: </strong>MongoDB is well positioned to benefit from the growth of generative AI as their document model is best-in-class at processing rich, complex data structures quickly, and with more AI applications and data ultimately increasing the demand for Databases, Rangan&nbsp;noted. The analyst remains confident in MongoDB&#8217;s ability to win an outsized share of the $100 billion+ database market that can support durable 20% growth mid-term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rangan expects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $$495 million and 67 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JMP Securities:</strong> The rating followed the company, indicating healthier new business trends and Atlas strength. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. The price target reflects a premium to the high-growth infrastructure peer group median multiple, which is warranted by MongoDB&#8217;s attractive market opportunity and strong leadership team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walravens expects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $496 million and 68 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action: </strong>MongoDB stock traded up 16.75% at $286.87 at last check Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40658314/chipmakers-tick-up-as-nvidia-halts-sell-off-dollar-rises-as-traders-revise-fed-wagers-whats-driv\">Chipmakers Tick Up As Nvidia Halts Sell-Off, Dollar Rises As Traders Revise Fed Wagers: What&#8217;s Driving Markets Friday?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image:</em> <em>Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T18:14:30Z", "headline": "MongoDB Atlas Revenue 'Solid,' AI Integration Set To Drive Strong Cash Flows: Analysts", "id": 40659559, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Mongodb-Sign-And-Logo-On-Silicon-Valley-_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Mongodb-Sign-And-Logo-On-Silicon-Valley-_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Mongodb-Sign-And-Logo-On-Silicon-Valley-_0.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "MongoDB stock rose after Q2 earnings beat expectations.

Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, told WSJ that the main challenge is getting these chips to function cohesively, as low yields in individual parts can lead to quick overall failure. Lisa Su, CEO of <strong>Advanced Micro Devices Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMD#NASDAQ\">AMD</a>), told WSJ that future complexity will rise as chipmakers stack more silicon layers for increased performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts rerated Nvidia after its upbeat <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/technicals/24/08/40635333/nvidia-stock-dips-despite-q2-earnings-beat-is-the-ai-rally-fading\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">second-quarter print</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wedbush </strong>analyst Matt Bryson reiterated an Outperform on Nvidia with a price target of $138.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia reported $30 billion in second-quarter sales driven by data center sales, which is in line with Bryson&#8217;s revised estimate, while management guided for $32.5 billion in revenues in the third quarter, which was just above his outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding Blackwell delays, management described a change to the Blackwell mask to improve yields, the analyst flagged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryson noted that Nvidia expects shipments to ramp up in the fourth quarter, eying revenue worth several billion dollars for Blackwell this year. Gross margins will likely be in the mid-70s for fiscal 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Hopper revenues will likely grow in the second half of fiscal 2025, as Nvidia indicated. While the stock dropped meaningfully after hours, Bryson did not note anything in numbers or in Nvidia&#8217;s commentary that was concerning or suggested any slowing in momentum fundamentally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryson calculated his price target by applying a price-to-earnings multiple of ~36x to his fiscal 2026 EPS estimate of $3.78 plus net cash of $1.01 per share. Bryson projects third-quarter revenue and EPS of $32.50 billion and 73 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rosenblatt </strong>analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a Buy rating with a price target of $200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mosesmann noted that Nvidia reported a solid beat and raise on Hopper&#8217;s generative AI and networking momentum, offset by slightly lower gross margins in the outlook due to Blackwell&#8217;s start-up ramp for the January quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackwell is undergoing a mask update to improve yields, but interestingly, the analyst said there will be no change to the January quarter revenue ramp going through the next fiscal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mosesmann argued that the company&#8217;s GPU roadmap is driven by accelerated computing, which has a significant ROI compared to general-purpose computing, and generative AI, which is still in its early stages of deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given Blackwell&#8217;s roadmap for the 2026 calendar year, the analyst remains bullish on the stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mosesmann noted unconstrained fiscal 2027 EPS of $4.50 and applied a ~44x PE multiple, which drives his price target within Nvidia&#8217;s historical 37x-69x forward PE range, backed by more robust Data Center demand dynamics.

Just one year later, Benthall was arrested by Agostino and the FBI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&#8217;Agostino provides insight into the investigation, explaining how they narrowed down their search. &#8220;Blake had a unique combination of skills and interests that made him stand out,&#8221; D&#8217;Agostino notes. He also discusses the decision to offer Benthall an opportunity to cooperate, recognizing his potential value as a technical asset to the FBI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years after his arrest and subsequent cooperation, Benthall founded Fathom(x), a company aimed at making cryptocurrency transactions more transparent and secure. &#8220;It&#8217;s about using my skills for good now,&#8221; Benthall points out. &#8220;We&#8217;re helping businesses prove their claimed assets and ensuring funds aren&#8217;t from illicit sources.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/ \"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27091545/Benzinga-conference.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga future of digital assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-267246\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40628056/heres-why-bitcoin-ethereum-solana-are-so-boring-now-compared-to-2021\">Here&#8217;s Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Are So Boring Now Compared To 2021</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Benthall and D&#8217;Agostino <a href=\"https://x.com/Rachelwolf00/status/1823817697509114014\">emphasize</a> the need for better education and tools in the crypto space. D&#8217;Agostino states, \"There&#8217;s this misconception that crypto is perfect for crime. In reality, its traceability makes it a terrible choice for illegal activities.\" Benthall adds, \"Our goal is to make scamming practically impossible on blockchains.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview also touches on the rapid evolution of the crypto industry. D&#8217;Agostino recalls, &#8220;I remember when <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) was just $100. We thought we&#8217;d missed the boat then!&#8221; Now, with Bitcoin&#8217;s value significantly higher, both guests stress that it&#8217;s not too late to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to the future, Benthall expresses excitement about building openly in the crypto space. &#8220;We&#8217;re at a turning point,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The technology is maturing, and we have the opportunity to shape its future.&#8221; D&#8217;Agostino agrees, highlighting the increasing mainstream adoption: &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-spot-bitcoin-etfs\">Bitcoin ETFs</a>, politicians talking about crypto&#8230; it&#8217;s becoming part of the mainstream financial conversation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&#8217;Agostino offers a final thought: &#8220;The crypto space is no longer the Wild West.

{"author": "Chris Katje", "content": "<p>A new JD Power study shows new discounts and financing options could help drive increased adoption rates <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/electric-vehicles\">of electric vehicles.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The average price of new EVs <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40156978/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-admits-lower-priced-evs-from-rival-automakers-are-a-problem-but-not-one-that-wil\">continues to decline </a>thanks to new more affordable models and discounting across the sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New discounts on EVs are helping to bring the price of an EV closer to gas-powered vehicles, according to the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240829827912/en/J.D.-Power-GlobalData-U.S.-Automotive-Forecast-for-August-2024\">report</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The JD Power EV Index, which tracks the prices of EVs to gas-powered vehicles, showed a score of 56 out of 100 in July \u2014 a record high. This marked the fifth straight month the JD Power EV Index parity score rose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Interest reached a high for the year with 28% of new-vehicle shoppers saying they are \u2018very likely' to consider a battery electric vehicle for their next purchase, but the industry seems to be struggling to attract more buyers than a year ago,\" JD Power Vice President, Electric Vehicle Practice <strong>Elizabeth Krear </strong>said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krear said availability has improved for EVs, which may have helped with the 28% figure, but it might have more to do with pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Incentives have helped align prices in popular compact and midsize mass market segments, making them more affordable. Mass market and premium BEVs are at and above parity with gas-powered alternatives \u2013 from a cost of ownership standpoint.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krear said battery-powered electric vehicle monthly retail sales were 9.2% for June and July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another item contributing to the increased interest from buyers is increased charging infrastructure options. Vehicle purchasers said companies like <strong>Ford </strong>and <strong>Rivian </strong>having access to the<strong> Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) Supercharger network was a contributing factor in buying an EV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40472254/move-over-ford-and-general-motors-theres-a-new-no-2-electric-vehicle-maker-in-the-us-behind-tesla\"> Move Over Ford And General Motors, There&#8217;s A New No. 2 Electric Vehicle Maker In The US Behind Tesla</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important: </strong>JD Power predicts U.S. automotive sales will hit 1.4 million in August, up 4.2% year-over-year. Along with EV seeing lower prices, the cost of a new vehicle is expected to be down for both EVs and traditional automobiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another positive area for EVs is the fact that there are more electric SUVs and electric pickup trucks now available to consumers. Trucks and SUVs are expected to make up 80% of new vehicle retail sales in August according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest JD Power report could be positive for Tesla as the company's vertical integration has helped the company lower the cost of mass-produced EVs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other traditional automakers like <strong>Ford Motor Company</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/F#NYSE\">F</a>) and <strong>General Motors Company</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GM#NYSE\">GM</a>) have struggled with making profitable EVs. Ford recently announced it was <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40496864/ford-scraps-electric-suv-as-it-adjusts-to-lower-electric-vehicle-demand\">scrapping its plans</a> on a new electric SUV and is delaying a new electric pickup truck from 2026 to 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford said it plans to spend less on EVs to cut costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EV companies and traditional automakers continue to walk a delicate tightrope of making affordable vehicles and also reigning in costs to work towards profitability. The JD Power survey shows demand may be greater than expected in the coming year if the incentives and lower costs continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/07/39918390/tesla-q2-earnings-highlights-revenue-beat-eps-miss-robotaxi-update-2024-growth-rate-to-be-notably-l\">Tesla Q2 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Miss, Robotaxi Update, 2024 Growth Rate To Be &#8216;Notably Lower&#8217; Than 2023</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T18:50:46Z", "headline": "Electric Vehicle Interest Hits Record In New US Study Thanks To Discounts, 28% Say Next Car Will Be EV", "id": 40660114, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Electric-Cars-Charging-Station-Closeup-P.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Electric-Cars-Charging-Station-Closeup-P.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Electric-Cars-Charging-Station-Closeup-P.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "A new JD Power survey shows a new high in interest for electric vehicles among U.S. consumers.", "symbols": ["F", "GM", "TSLA"], "updated_at": "2024-08-30T18:50:47Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40660114/electric-vehicle-interest-hits-record-in-new-us-study-thanks-to-discounts-28-say-next-car-will-be-ev"}

This change further supports the notion that federally recognized tribes could initiate <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/05/39114778/2-5m-loan-for-tribal-cannabis-facility-approved-by-minnesota-state-agency-overriding-board-oppos\">legal cannabis operations</a>, provided they manage cultivation and production on their sovereign lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://benzinga.com/topic/Louisiana-cannabis\">Louisiana</a>, several tribes operate under charters that could feasibly include language allowing such activities, particularly those with existing gaming facilities. However, for these tribes to venture into the marijuana industry, they would need to undertake all levels of production on tribal land, from cultivation to packaging, circumventing not only state but also federal regulations that bind non-tribal entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Progressive Shifts In Louisiana Cannabis Policies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, no Louisiana tribes have publicly announced plans to exploit this legal pathway.
