{"author": "Anan Ashraf", "content": "<p>Electric vehicle (EV) registrations in July in the U.S. reportedly marked an 18% increase as compared to the same month last year owing to the success of the <strong>Tesla Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40791286/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-considers-making-steering-yoke-stationary-while-cybertruck-parks-itself\">Cybertruck</a>, among other vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Tesla had a 1.2% increase in registrations in July, propelled by 5,175 deliveries of Cybertruck, CBT News <a href=\"https://www.cbtnews.com/ev-registrations-surged-18-in-july-boosted-by-tesla-cybertruck-and-new-models/\">reported</a>, citing S&amp;P Global Mobility data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybertruck is Tesla&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40867760/elon-musk-reacts-as-tesla-makes-100-millionth-4680-cells-enough-to-produce-over-73-500-cybertrucks\">latest offering</a>, up against popular vehicles such as Ford&#8217;s F-150 Lightning and the Rivian R1T in the electric pickup segment in the U.S. However, only 5,546 electric pickup units from other brands were sold during the period, the report noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40868156/former-democratic-senator-al-franken-says-biden-is-wrong-to-impose-higher-tariffs-on-evs-made-in-chi\">Former Democratic Senator Al Franken Says Biden Is Wrong To Impose Higher Tariffs On EVs Made In China</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> While Tesla continues to dominate EV sales, non-Tesla EV registrations also surged 38% year-over-year.

The analyst based his data on the\u00a0latest supply chain survey and pre-order results from Apple's official websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-tech-stocks\">Best Tech Stocks Right Now</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo noted that the soft Max series demand is due to the fact that Apple Intelligence, the major selling point, is not available at launch. He also pointed to intense competition in China, especially from Huawei and other home-grown rivals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, data from China, Apple&#8217;s key market, on Saturday showed the economy is still struggling with softness, and this along with competition could pressure the company&#8217;s sales in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the weakness may have to do with the across-the-sector negativity, with investors fearing that a Federal Reserve rate cut could stall the tech rally as they shift their investment dollars into underperforming, small-cap stocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In  premarket trading, Apple lost its flavor and fell 1.93% to $218.20, according to<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\"> Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Next:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40869770/no-razzle-dazzle-with-latest-iphone-but-apple-wowed-with-these-2-glowtime-announcements-says-gur\"><strong>No &#8216;Razzle-Dazzle&#8217; With Latest iPhone, But Apple Wowed With These 2 &#8216;Glowtime&#8217; Announcements, Says Gurman</strong></a></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T11:17:34Z", "headline": "Apple Shares Slide In Monday Premarket: What's Souring Sentiment?", "id": 40874566, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/7-Products-Apple-Will-Likely-Discontinue.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/7-Products-Apple-Will-Likely-Discontinue.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/7-Products-Apple-Will-Likely-Discontinue.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Shares of Apple, Inc.

{"author": "Anan Ashraf", "content": "<p><strong>SpaceX</strong> CEO <strong>Elon Musk </strong>on Monday said there is a need for a new visible spectrum space telescope to replace or assist the Hubble space telescope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> &#8220;Hubble is cool, but there needs to be a new visible spectrum space telescope with far larger aperture,&#8221; Musk said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hubble is cool, but there needs to be a new visible spectrum space telescope with far larger aperture</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1835590890116559257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hubble space telescope was launched to low-Earth orbit in 1990. Since then it has been orbiting Earth at an altitude of about 340 miles, capturing images. The Hubble has been serviced multiple times on orbit since, the latest of which was in 2009. It is now expected to last until 2030-2040.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> <strong>Shift4 Payments</strong> CEO and commercial astronaut <strong>Jared Isaacman</strong> previously proposed to service the telescope as part of his human spaceflight program called Polaris. The program is expected to embark on three human spaceflight missions with SpaceX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, NASA has yet to greenlight the proposal for Hubble to be serviced on a Polaris mission, <strong>National Public Radio</strong> (NPR) reported in May. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polaris Dawn, the first of up to three human spaceflight missions planned under the Polaris program, was launched last week by a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. During the five-day mission, the crew, onboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, touched a maximum altitude of over 870 miles and conducted the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40872104/polaris-dawn-returns-home-after-5-day-mission-including-first-commercial-spacewalk\"> first-ever commercial spacewalk</a> on Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The successful spacewalk and demonstration of the ability to touch high altitudes on the Polaris Dawn mission might help alleviate NASA&#8217;s concerns about the ability to service the Hubble telescope with a future Polaris mission using SpaceX hardware. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga&#8217;s Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>following this link</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40849409/former-top-gear-host-james-may-thinks-a-vehicle-the-size-of-a-fiat-panda-but-styled-like-tesla-cyber?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Former Top Gear Host James May Thinks A Vehicle The Size Of A Fiat Panda But Styled Like Tesla Cybertruck Might Look \u2018Fantastic'</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: NASA</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T11:52:05Z", "headline": "Elon Musk Says There Is A Need For A Space Telescope With 'Far Larger Aperture' Than Hubble", "id": 40875440, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Hubble-space-telescope.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Hubble-space-telescope.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Hubble-space-telescope.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Monday said there is a need for a new visible spectrum space telescope to replace or assist the Hubble space telescope.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T11:52:06Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40875440/elon-musk-says-there-is-a-need-for-a-space-telescope-with-far-larger-aperture-than-hubble"}

The U.S. continues to push for a democratic resolution to Venezuela&#8217;s ongoing political crisis, CNN <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/14/americas/venezuela-arrests-americans-seizes-rifles-intl-latam/index.html\">reported</a> on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela had previously announced the arrest of six individuals, accusing them of involvement in a plot to destabilize the country, which has been in political chaos since disputed elections earlier this year.

The company reported quarterly sales of $6.174 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $5.822 billion, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent buzz around Sunoco, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Sunoco has a dividend yield of 6.55%. That&#8217;s a quarterly dividend amount of 87.56 cents a share ($3.502 a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Sunoco, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we take this amount and divide it by Sunoco's $3.502 dividend: $6,000 / $3.502 = 1,713 shares</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, an investor would need to own approximately $91,646 worth of Sunoco, or 1,713 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $3.502 = 343 shares, or $18,351 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SUN Price Action</strong>: Shares of Sunoco rose 0.4% to close at $53.50 on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVF0O2lsEH4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/09/40860420/jim-cramer-hold-on-to-builders-firstsource-heres-the-problem-with-viking-therapeutics\">Jim Cramer: &#8216;Hold On&#8217; To Builders FirstSource, &#8216;Here&#8217;s The Problem&#8217; With Viking Therapeutics</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T12:30:40Z", "headline": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Sunoco Stock", "id": 40876798, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/sunoco-shutterstock.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/sunoco-shutterstock.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/sunoco-shutterstock.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Sunoco has a dividend yield of 6.55%, or $87.56 cents a share.

{"author": "Murtuza Merchant", "content": "<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is revisiting its case against crypto exchange <strong>Binance</strong>, aiming to strengthen <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/07/40041451/sec-aims-to-amend-binance-complaint-focusing-on-third-party-crypto-asset-securities\">its original lawsuit</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: In a court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.273.2.pdf\">filing</a> last Thursday, the SEC proposed an amended complaint to address concerns raised by a judge earlier this year and provide further evidence that Binance allegedly engaged in selling unregistered securities, Coindesk <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/16/sec-places-heavier-scrutiny-on-binances-token-listing-trading-process-in-proposed-amended-complaint/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines\">reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC initially filed its lawsuit against Binance in June 2023, accusing the exchange of operating as an unregistered broker and clearinghouse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also included claims of Binance offering unregistered securities through its native BNB (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/bnb/usd\">BNB</a>) token and BUSD (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/busd/usd\">BUSD</a>) stablecoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit faced a partial dismissal in June 2024, when Judge <strong>Amy Berman</strong> Jackson ruled that some charges tied to Binance&#8217;s Simple Earn product and secondary BNB sales were not sufficiently supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the SEC is now seeking to amend its complaint, addressing the judge's concerns and further highlighting how Binance allegedly promoted 10 cryptocurrencies\u2014such as <strong>Solana </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/sol/usd\">SOL</a>) and <strong>Cardano</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/ada/usd\">ADA</a>)\u2014as unregistered securities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC clarified in its filing, &#8220;The MTD Order dismissed these claims based on insufficient factual allegations to meet the Howey test, as opposed to a defective legal theory.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed amendment alleges that Binance played a central role in promoting digital assets listed on its platform, including its native BNB token. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It states that Binance marketed BNB to investors as an &#8220;exchange token,&#8221; claiming it was a key part of the exchange&#8217;s success and driving up its value.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27091545/Benzinga-conference.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga future of digital assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-267246\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40874541/anthony-scaramucci-more-gop-officials-will-start-to-denounce-trump-senator-mitt-romney-may\">Anthony Scaramucci: &#8216;More GOP Officials Will Start To Denounce Trump&#8217; \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney May Be One Of Them, Polymarket Traders Think</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the SEC accused Binance of compensating U.S. employees with BNB in a manner similar to employee stock options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to Binance's likely opposition to the amendment, the SEC argued that the exchange and its executives have been aware of the allegations since June 2023, and the amended complaint does not introduce new claims that would unduly harm the defendants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated complaint also emphasizes the alleged risks tied to Binance's Simple Earn product and other digital assets, including Solana, <strong>Polygon </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/matic/usd\">MATIC</a>), and <strong>Axie Infinity</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/axs/usd\">AXS</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC contends that Binance amplified the promotional activities of the issuers of these tokens, encouraging its customers to invest in them by presenting them as attractive investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further clarify its stance, the SEC addressed its previous use of the term &#8220;crypto asset securities&#8221; and acknowledged it may have caused confusion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agency reiterated that it was not arguing that the crypto assets themselves were securities, but rather that the assets were sold as part of unregistered investment contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This legal battle will likely continue to evolve as Binance is expected to oppose the SEC's motion by Oct. 11. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With high-stakes regulatory scrutiny on crypto exchanges and assets, the industry will be watching closely to see how this case impacts the broader regulatory landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong>: The timing of this legal dispute is notable as Benzinga's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\">Future of Digital Assets</a> event on Nov. 19 is set to explore critical topics around crypto regulation and the evolving digital asset market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40860002/heres-how-much-donald-trumps-crypto-portfolio-is-down-from-the-top-spoiler-its-millions-an\">Here&#8217;s How Much Donald Trump&#8217;s Crypto Portfolio Is Down From The Top (Spoiler: It&#8217;s Millions And Millions Of Dollars)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ", "created_at": "2024-09-16T12:35:52Z", "headline": "SEC Moves To Amend Binance Lawsuit, Reinforcing Claims Of Unregistered Securities Sales", "id": 40876874, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Binance-Photo-by-Iryna-Budanova-on-Shutt.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Binance-Photo-by-Iryna-Budanova-on-Shutt.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Binance-Photo-by-Iryna-Budanova-on-Shutt.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is revisiting its case against crypto exchange Binance, aiming to strengthen its original lawsuit.", "symbols": ["ADAUSD", "AXSUSD", "BNBUSD", "BUSDUSD", "MATICUSD", "SOLUSD"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T12:35:53Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40876874/sec-moves-to-amend-binance-lawsuit-reinforcing-claims-of-unregistered-securities-sales"}

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p><strong>Amazon Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>) is preparing to dispatch hundreds of small satellites into orbit, setting the stage for a face-off with <strong>Elon Musk</strong>&#8216;s<strong> SpaceX</strong> in the U.K.&#8217;s airspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Amazon is planning to launch over 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide internet connectivity to remote areas, The Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/15/bezos-takes-on-musk-in-battle-300-miles-above-britain/\">reported</a> on Monday. The first rocket mission is slated for the end of the year. This move places Amazon&#8217;s executive chairman, <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, in direct competition with Musk, whose company SpaceX has already launched a 6,000-satellite constellation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SpaceX, valued at a reported $200 billion, already has 42,000 customers in the U.K. and is seeking to expand its service. Meanwhile, Amazon is awaiting approval from the U.K.&#8217;s telecom regulator, Ofcom, to bring its service to the U.K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40853157/united-airlines-inks-deal-with-elon-musks-spacex-to-provide-free-inflight-wi-fi-via-starlink?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">United Airlines Inks Deal With Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX To Provide Free Inflight Wi-Fi Via Starlink</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite SpaceX&#8217;s significant head start, industry insiders believe Amazon has the potential to challenge Starlink, especially with its cash reserve expected to reach $100 billion this year. Amazon&#8217;s venture is less focused on profit and more on expanding its global broadband network and Prime customer base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rivalry between Bezos and Musk could soon intensify in the U.K.&#8217;s broadband and mobile market, with satellite technology seen as a potential alternative to costly and disruptive roadworks for fibre installation in remote areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This development comes as a continuation of the escalating space race between Bezos and Musk. Earlier this month, Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation initiative, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/space/24/09/40697380/bezos-vs-musk-battle-heads-to-space-how-amazon-founder-is-taking-tesla-ceo-on-more-directly\">secured eight licenses</a> and purchased land in New Zealand. This move coincided with Musk&#8217;s SpaceX satellite service, Starlink, expanding its customer base in New Zealand from 12,000 to 37,000 in 2023. As the billionaires vie for dominance in the UK&#8217;s skies, the competition is expected to reshape the country&#8217;s broadband and mobile market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40869770/no-razzle-dazzle-with-latest-iphone-but-apple-wowed-with-these-2-glowtime-announcements-says-gur?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">No &#8216;Razzle-Dazzle&#8217; With Latest iPhone, But Apple Wowed With These 2 &#8216;Glowtime&#8217; Announcements, Says Gurman</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Images via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Pooja-Rajkumari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pooja Rajkumari</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T12:45:05Z", "headline": "Jeff Bezos And Elon Musk Set To Battle For Dominance In The Sky: Amazon Gears Up To Launch Over 3,000 Low-Earth Orbit Satellites", "id": 40877089, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Elon-Musk--Jeff-Bezos-And-Other-Ultra-Ri.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Elon-Musk--Jeff-Bezos-And-Other-Ultra-Ri.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Elon-Musk--Jeff-Bezos-And-Other-Ultra-Ri.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Despite SpaceX&#39;s significant head start, industry insiders believe Amazon has the potential to challenge Starlink.", "symbols": ["AMZN"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T12:45:05Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40877089/jeff-bezos-and-elon-musk-set-to-battle-for-dominance-in-the-sky-amazon-gears-up-to-launch-over-3-000"}

This has been a critical driver of Tencent's impressive advertising revenue growth, enabling advertisers to reach consumers more effectively and boost click-through rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a space where precision is everything, Tencent's AI models are proving invaluable. But the company isn't stopping there. Yan highlights how Tencent is \"equipping advertisers with generative AI tools that can dynamically create ad visuals tailored for various ad placements.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This capability allows advertisers to produce more engaging, customized ads on the fly, which has the potential to supercharge their marketing efforts and drive even more revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Tencent&#8217;s TikTok Rival &#8211; WeChat Is Capitalizing On New Opportunities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tencent's flagship platforms, particularly <strong>WeChat</strong> and its video account feature (a rival to ByteDance's <strong>Douyin</strong> and <strong>TikTok</strong>), still have \"substantial untapped potential for further monetization,\" according to Yan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating AI technologies could unlock new opportunities to capitalize on this potential. In fact, Tencent's Executive Director and President, <strong>Martin Lau</strong>, mentioned in a recent earnings call that AI is expected to provide a near-term boost in ad revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Yan, even a modest 10% increase in ad load within the WeChat and video account ecosystem could generate an additional RMB 10 billion (approx. $1.4 billion), most of which would go straight to profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"AI To 'Turbocharge' Alibaba's Cloud In Bid To Rival Microsoft, Amazon, Says Strategist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Read Also: EXCLUSIVE: AI To &#8216;Turbocharge&#8217; Alibaba&#8217;s Cloud In Bid To Rival Microsoft, Amazon, Says Strategist</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tencent&#8217;s Advertising Getting Stronger</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With AI integration driving both operational efficiency and revenue growth, Tencent's advertising game is only getting stronger.

It surveyed 1,002 registered voters, with the margin of error at plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debate watchers viewed her economic stewardship as better than those who didn&#8217;t, the poll found. The debate was watched by about 67 million Americans, FT said, citing Nielsen data. Nearly, 75% of respondents who watched the debate said they watched all or part of the 90-minute debate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40867103/nate-silver-if-trump-loses-he-will-have-let-election-slip-out-of-his-grasp-as-underlying-factors-fav\">Nate Silver: If Trump Loses, He Will Have Let Election &#8216;Slip Out Of His Grasp&#8217; As Underlying Factors Favor Him Despite Harris&#8217; Poll Lead</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Debate Redeems Harris: </strong>Forty-eight percent of debate watchers said they trusted Harris more to manage the economy, while slightly less than 42% said the same about Trump. On the contrary, among those who didn&#8217;t watch the debate, Trump had an edge (41%) over Harris (35%) regarding their credentials to steward the economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll also found that Harris was trusted significantly more than President<strong> Joe Biden</strong> on the economy. Biden never beat Trump on the question of who voters trusted more to manage the economy, and Harris's support, from 44% of Americans, is an eight-point improvement over Biden, the pollster said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The numbers prove that Harris might be getting her messaging right and was succeeding in distancing from an &#8220;unpopular incumbent even without articulating a clear economic agenda that differs from Biden's,&#8221; FT said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris led Trump by a margin of 44%-43% as someone who can be trusted to lower costs of every necessity like food and fuel. She is also viewed as more trusted to help the unemployed find a job, by a similarly tight 44% to 42%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris is seen as better representing the interests of the middle class:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>middle class (49%-36%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>small businesses (48%-37%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>union members (45%-35%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>blue-collar workers (43%-36%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Trump was seen as better representing the interests of large corporations by a 64%-20% margin and the wealthy by a 67%-19% margin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Voters also think [Harris] represents \u2018people just like them' better, and that is important given the tendency of people to vote for the candidate they think will do the most for them,\" said<strong> Erik Gordon</strong>, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One Sore Point: </strong> Voters, however, believed they would be better off if Trump were re-elected as he led Harris by a 40%-35% margin on this count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll is likely to be welcomed by the vice president's campaign, given &#8220;Harris and the Democrats have historically struggled to convince voters that they are better stewards of the economy than their Republican counterparts,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pushback against her is that is economy is not her forte. Former White House Communications Director <strong>Anthony Scaramucci</strong>, who was brought in as one of her surrogates during last week&#8217;s debate, said in a recent podcast that she has to get the message across that <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40869771/anthony-scaramucci-explains-how-kamala-harris-can-improve-her-poor-economic-polling-she-has-to-get-o\">she can lead Americans to a better economic future than Trump.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Check This Out:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Lawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</strong></a></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T12:21:52Z", "headline": "Trump Vs.

The next day, French President <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> put forward his name for a second mandate in the College of Commissioners. However, during the final negotiations on the future College&#8217;s composition, France was requested to retract Breton&#8217;s nomination due to undisclosed personal reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breton disclosed in his statement that he was presented with a more influential portfolio for France in the future College as a political compromise. However, he chose to resign, attributing his decision to &#8220;questionable governance.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues in the College, Commission services, MEPs, Member States, and my team.<br><br>Together, we have worked tirelessly to advance an ambitious EU agenda. <br><br>It has been an honour &amp; privilege to serve the common European interest&#x1f1ea;&#x1f1fa; <a href=\"https://t.co/wQ4eeHUnYu\">pic.twitter.com/wQ4eeHUnYu</a></p>&mdash; Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1835565206639972734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40868937/mary-trump-says-her-uncle-is-a-deeply-unwell-traitor-he-knows-he-just-needs-to-keep-it-close-enough?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary Trump Says Her Uncle Is A &#8216;Deeply Unwell Traitor&#8217;: &#8216;He Knows He Just Needs To Keep It Close Enough So He Can Cheat&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Breton&#8217;s resignation comes as a surprise, considering his significant role in shaping the EU&#8217;s policies.

This decision is made as the retail sector prepares for the slowest holiday sales growth in 6 years, according to Deloitte data, Reuters reported on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seasonal staff will be assigned to Target&#8217;s stores and supply chain facilities, with the majority being stationed in stores. This follows <strong>Bath &amp; Body Works</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BBWI#NYSE\">BBWI</a>) announcement last week to hire 30,000 seasonal employees, mirroring its 2023 figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40847331/gary-gensler-led-sec-directs-crypto-firm-to-halt-trading-for-all-coins-but-bitcoin-ethereu?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gary Gensler-Led SEC Directs Crypto Firm To Halt Trading For All Coins But Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Bitcoin Cash \u2014 What Does It Mean?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With inflation worries looming, consumers are likely to be more cautious during the crucial shopping season. Target aims to attract value-conscious shoppers by offering more affordable holiday items, including over half of holiday toys priced under $20 and thousands of stocking stuffers under $5. Earlier this year, Target reduced prices on over 5,000 popular items, leading to a raised full-year profit forecast after reporting positive quarterly comparable sales. The company also announced the commencement of its deals week program, Target Circle, from Oct. 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Target has been on an upward trajectory <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40514323/targets-q2-beat-fuels-analyst-optimism-with-strong-outlook-strategic-initiatives\">since last November,</a> rallying nearly 77% from its October low. The company&#8217;s strong second-quarter financial results and raised outlook have fueled analyst optimism. Target has increased its full-year 2024 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $9.00 to $9.70, up from the previous range of $8.60 to $9.60.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CNBC's \"Mad Money\" host <strong>Jim Cramer</strong> declared that Target is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40576938/jim-cramer-declares-target-is-back-as-strong-earnings-report-from-retail-giant-assu\">back on track </a>after a period of struggle, following an earnings report that surpassed market expectations.

{"author": "Piero Cingari", "content": "<p>The Federal Reserve is set to cut the federal funds rate for the first time in over four years at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday. The size of the cut is a subject of debate <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/interest-rates\">as the meeting approaches.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key options on the table are either a 25-basis-point cut or a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut. As of Monday morning, investors and speculators slightly lean toward the larger 50-basis-point cut. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recent Media Articles Push Market Expectations Toward 0.5% Cut</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, market participants are leaning slightly toward the latter. According to CME Group&#8217;s FedWatch tool, Fed futures are pricing in a 65% probability of a 50-basis-point cut as of 8:00 a.m. Monday, up significantly from just 30% a week ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, betting markets tracked by Polymarket are now assigning a 58% chance of a half-point cut, up from a mere 9% last Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication from Federal Reserve officials prior to the pre-FOMC blackout period, initially suggested a 25 basis point cut to 5.00-5.25%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, recent media reports indicating it&#8217;s a close call have since shifted market expectations toward the possibility of a larger 50 basis point cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Wall Street Journal reporter <strong>Nick Timiraos</strong> and Bloomberg Opinion columnist<strong> Bill Dudley</strong> have published articles driving market sentiment towards the half-a-percentage-point option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WSJ article stated that the FOMC &#8220;are confronting questions over whether to cut by a traditional 0.25 percentage point or by a larger 0.5 point.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dudley, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, argued the logic for a 50-basis-point cut is &#8220;compelling.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stressed that the Fed&#8217;s dual mandate\u2014price stability and maximum sustainable employment\u2014has come into closer balance. This suggests that monetary policy should be neutral. Yet, current short-term interest rates remain significantly above neutral. That&#8217;s a disparity Dudley believes should be corrected quickly with an outsized cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wall Street Analysts Predict a 25-Basis-Point Cut</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are forecasting a more modest 25 basis point cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank of America rates strategist <strong>Mark Cabana</strong>, <strong>CFA</strong> expects a 25-basis-point reduction at the September FOMC meeting, noting that Fed officials did not signal a larger cut before the blackout period. Additionally, recent U.S. inflation data has been slightly firm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a low-conviction Fed, and the policy path will hinge on the data rather than forward guidance. On balance, we expect the market to interpret the September FOMC as delivering a neutral to dovish cut,&#8221; Cabana stated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also anticipates 75 basis points of cuts in 2024, suggesting two additional 25-basis-point reductions in November and December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Goldman Sachs economist <strong>David Mericle</strong> expects a 25-basis-point cut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A larger cut would be &#8220;somewhat out of keeping with usual Fed practice,&#8221; Mericle says. They are typically delivered during an obvious crisis or a significant spike in unemployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming the FOMC delivers the 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday, Mericle expects the median dot plot to indicate three additional 25-basis-point cuts in 2024.

This highlights the complex legal and ethical issues surrounding data use for AI training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, Meta paused these plans after discussions with the UK&#39;s Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO), but now it plans to simplify opt-out procedures for users who don&#39;t want their data used this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICO hasn&#39;t approved the plan but will monitor it to ensure privacy compliance.

In the UK, Meta will only use publicly shared posts for AI training, excluding private messages and data from minors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company aims to reflect British culture accurately and help UK businesses benefit from new technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta emphasizes transparency and strong safeguards in data handling, and the ICO stresses the importance of these measures, noting that while no explicit approval has been given, Meta must comply with ongoing standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2024-09-16_11-13-12.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u517520/2024-09-16_11-13-12.png\" style=\"height:308px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Meta has been active with data use and AI training, its stock performance tells another story. After falling by 75% between September 2021 and November 2022, the stock rebounded with a 500% rise by April 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is now facing resistance around $540.

{"author": "Dmitriy Gurkovskiy", "content": "<p>By <a href=\"https://roboforex.com/beginners/analytics/forex-forecast/?utm_source=benzinga.com&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=rf_en_external_article_16092024&amp;utm_content=analysis&amp;utm_term=forecast\">RoboForex Analytical Department</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/USD is showing signs of strengthening, currently trading around 1.1088 on Monday. The pair saw significant gains at the end of last week, driven by mounting speculation over the Federal Reserve&#39;s upcoming interest rate decision. The US dollar weakened in response to increasing expectations that the Fed might cut rates by 50 basis points in its forthcoming meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shift in market sentiment has been substantial, with the probability of a 50 basis point cut now at 45%, up from just 20% a week earlier. This anticipation has led to a decrease in US Treasury bond yields, further affecting the dollar&#39;s strength. Additionally, US import prices fell more than expected in August, decreasing by 0.3%, and export prices dropped by 0.7%. A sentiment index from the University of Michigan also showed an improvement in annual inflation expectations in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the European Central Bank (ECB), which reduced its rate last week, continues to assert its independence. ECB President Christine Lagarde reiterated that the ECB operates free of political influence, responding to Italian demands for further rate reductions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, scheduled to start on Tuesday and conclude on Wednesday with a rate decision and commentary, is the focal point for markets this week. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, which could significantly impact the EUR/USD dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Technical Analysis Of EUR/USD</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/eurusdh4_65.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/eurusdh4_65.png\" style=\"height:275px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR/USD market has established a consolidation range around 1.1088, extending down to 1.1073 and up to 1.1104. The market may potentially move downward to 1.1055 before possibly climbing to 1.1106, with a further stretch to 1.1128. The formation of a &lsquo;Triangle&rsquo; technical pattern is considered likely. This scenario is supported by the MACD indicator, which is below zero but trending upward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/eurusdh1_66.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/eurusdh1_66.png\" style=\"height:275px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A growth wave to 1.1100 has been completed on the H1 chart. The market is currently forming a consolidation range around 1.1088, with a corrective structure down to 1.1073 followed by an emerging growth structure towards 1.1106. After reaching this level, a decline to 1.1055 may be considered. The Stochastic oscillator, currently below 80 and heading towards 20, supports this potential downward movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disclaimer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author&#39;s particular opinion.

{"author": "Abbey Higginbotham", "content": "<p>The rise of Delta-8 THC, a hemp-derived cannabinoid, has ignited debate within the cannabis industry <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/delta-8-thc\">about its regulation</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Will Muecke</strong>, co-founder of <strong>Artemis Growth Partners</strong>, addressed this issue during an exclusive interview with Benzinga, urging tighter controls on synthetic cannabinoids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muecke, an upcoming speaker for the <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/cannabis-conference/\">Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</a></strong>, discussed the regulatory challenges surrounding Delta-8 THC and the need for reform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Demand for Regulation and Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Muecke did not mince words when discussing the current state of the Delta-8 THC market: \"Any synthetic derivative that&#8217;s an intoxicating agent that&#8217;s going in the body, it should be tested, and it should be regulated.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muecke's comments align with the increasing call for reform within the cannabis industry, where the lack of consistent regulation has allowed the widespread sale of untested products. Delta-8 THC has grown in popularity due to its legal status in some states, but without uniform safety measures, concerns about product safety continue to rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We shouldn&#8217;t be having a free-for-all of Delta-8 and other synthetic derivations off the hemp market,&#8221; Muecke said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Current Chaos in the Market</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In discussing the unregulated production of Delta-8 THC, Muecke described the current state of affairs as disorganized and unsafe. \"Right now, it&#8217;s a total free-for-all, and we got a bunch of folks that are making stuff in garage labs and selling it out of a website,\" he explained. His comments reflect concerns that the unregulated nature of these products could lead to health risks for consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absence of uniform regulations for Delta-8 THC has resulted in a fragmented market, with varying standards across states. Muecke pointed out that proper safety protocols and regulatory oversight are essential to protect consumers and maintain industry credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Unified Approach to Regulation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Muecke also called for cooperation between the hemp industry and the regulated cannabis market, which are often divided over regulatory issues like Delta-8 THC. \"I think there has to be harmonization between the regulated market and the hemp lobby, and we shouldn&#8217;t be fighting each other,\" he said, emphasizing the importance of a unified approach to address the industry's regulatory challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Muecke prepares to speak at the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference, his focus on regulation and consumer safety brings attention to the broader conversation about the future of cannabis regulation in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Role of Science and Safety</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Muecke concluded by stressing that science and safety should guide the regulatory process for synthetic cannabinoids. \"Delta-8 and all of the synthetics should go away. I think science and safety should prevail, and we should regulate these markets to have free and clear access,\" he said. His remarks underscore the importance of implementing safety measures to ensure consumers access tested, regulated products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muecke's emphasis on science-backed regulations offers a clear direction for the cannabis industry as it seeks to navigate the evolving market of synthetic cannabinoids like Delta-8 THC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Benzinga edit with images by Hannah Spray Photography and PNOIARSA on Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T13:46:27Z", "headline": "Should Delta-8 THC Be Regulated?

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>The U.S. economy is not in need of a substantial rate cut to maintain its growth, according to <strong>Carl Weinberg</strong>, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Weinberg discussed the state of the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policy decisions,  in a recent <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/09/16/u-s-economy-doesnt-need-a-strong-rate-cut-to-keep-on-growing-economist.html\">interview</a> with CNBC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weinberg stated that the U.S. economy doesn&#8217;t require a significant rate cut to continue growing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This economy doesn&#8217;t need a strong rate cut to keep on growing. It needs care and maintenance. It doesn&#8217;t need drastic treatment,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He highlighted that the U.S. economy is not contracting and job creation is steady, with approximately 117,000 jobs added per month over the last quarter. The consumer sector also remains robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40722526/kamala-harris-reveals-28-capital-gains-tax-for-high-earners-toning-down-bidens-proposed-rates-ahead?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kamala Harris Reveals 28% Capital Gains Tax For High Earners, Toning Down Biden&#8217;s Proposed Rates Ahead Of \u00a02024 Election</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Weinberg acknowledged a case for easing monetary conditions, he doesn&#8217;t see a strong case for an emergency cut of 50 basis points. Instead, he suggested a more modest cut of 25 basis points is more likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These comments come at a time when the Federal Reserve is considering monetary policy decisions amidst a slowing, yet still growing, economy.

The analysts predict that a dovish rate cycle and a new crypto cycle could reawaken crypto lending markets, as <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/316552/defi-yields-us-rate-cuts-bernstein?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\">reported</a> by TheBlock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The indicator of a recovering crypto DeFi market is seen in the doubling of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi. From its 2022 low, the TVL increased to $77 billion, and a three to four times increase in monthly DeFi users since the lows. Stablecoins are also back at highs of around $178 billion, and monthly active wallets remain stable at around 30 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ether has struggled relative to <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>), analysts suggest that strengthening DeFi lending markets on Ethereum could attract large whales and institutional investors back to the crypto credit markets. This could provide a catalyst to stem Ether's underperformance relative to Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27091545/Benzinga-conference.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga future of digital assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-267246\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40857676/what-changed-federal-reserve-may-take-a-bigger-50-basis-points-rate-cut-bite-next-week-mar\">&#8216;What Changed?&#8217; \u2014 Federal Reserve May Take A Bigger 50 Basis Points Rate Cut Bite Next Week, Market Odds Imply</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The potential resurgence of DeFi yields could have significant implications for the crypto market. This could lead to a boost in digital asset prices and potentially attract large investors back to the crypto credit markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the analysts, if the credit appetite of crypto traders increases, stablecoin DeFi yields could rise above 5%, surpassing those offered by U.S. dollar money market funds. This could further stimulate crypto credit markets and boost digital asset prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of this trend, Bernstein has added the Aave token to its digital assets portfolio, replacing derivative protocols GMX and Synthetix.

{"author": "RIPS", "content": "<p>Good Morning Traders! In today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#39;s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#39;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The SPY is currently trading near 561.90, a key level to watch. For the bulls, a push above 563.23 could set the stage for further upside. If buyers manage to maintain momentum beyond this point, we expect a move to the next target at 564.29. Holding 564.29 as support during regular hours may pave the way for a rally to 565.38. If buying pressure persists, we could see a bullish target of 566.46 by the session&#39;s close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the downside, if SPY struggles to maintain 561.90 as support, we could see selling pressure take over. Bears may test 560.83, and if the selling intensifies, they could drive the price lower to 559.75. A break below this could bring a stronger test at 558.32. If the market experiences aggressive selling, our low bear target for SPY today would be 557.44.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The QQQ is currently trading around 474.66, an important level for bulls to hold. If buyers can maintain control above this level, we could see a test of 476.85. A sustained move beyond this could lead to a challenge of 479.03, with further bullish activity potentially pushing the price to 481.73. In a strong upward scenario, the high bull target for today would be 483.95.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If QQQ fails to hold 474.66, bears may step in and target 471.33. A break lower could bring a move to 469.27, with persistent selling pressure likely testing 467.60. If this level does not hold, the bears may drive the price down to our low bear target for the day at 465.93.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apple Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple is currently auctioning around the 218.08 level. For the bulls to stay in control, we need to see 218.08 hold as support. A rally could take the price to 219.19, with continued buying pressure driving it further up to 220.29. If Apple shows strength, a bullish move may lead to a test of the high bull target for the day at 220.97.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should 218.08 fail to hold, bears will likely aim for a test of 216.70. Further selling could bring the price down to 215.25, with persistent downward momentum possibly driving Apple lower to 214.07. If the selloff intensifies, our low bear target for the day would be 212.44.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft is trading around the key level of 430.25. Bulls will look to hold above this level, targeting a move to 431.25. If buyers can maintain strength above this point, we may see a rally to 432.49. A continued push to the upside could bring Microsoft to the high bull target of 434.49 by the end of the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 430.25 cannot hold as support, bears may take control and drive the price down to 429.25. A break below this level could lead to a test of 428.48. Should selling pressure persist, Microsoft may see further downside to 427.36, with the low bear target set at 426.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NVIDIA is trading near 116.61, a critical level for bulls to defend. A move higher could target 117.86, with further bullish momentum driving the price to 119.44. If buying pressure remains strong, we may see a rally up to 120.27, with the high bull target for NVIDIA at 121.97.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 116.61 breaks to the downside, we could see bears push the price lower to 115.83. A break below this level could lead to a test of 115.15, with continued selling likely bringing the price down to 114.29. Should the selloff deepen, the low bear target for NVIDIA today would be 113.68.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alphabet is currently trading near 157.41, a key support level for bulls. A hold above this level could trigger a move to 158.54. If buyers maintain momentum, we could see a test of the high bull target at 160.36. A strong bull-side auction may drive prices higher throughout the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 157.41 cannot hold as support, sellers may take over, pushing Alphabet down to 156.61. If selling continues, we could see a test of 155.59, with further downside momentum potentially targeting the low bear level of 154.95.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta is trading near 526.29, which is a critical level for bulls to maintain. A sustained push above this level could lead to a move to 531.03. If the auction remains strong, bulls could target 534.33. A solid breakout from this point might result in Meta reaching the high bull target at 537.68.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 526.29 breaks to the downside, bears could push Meta down to 520.27. Continued selling pressure may lead to a test of 515.39. If sellers dominate the session, we could see Meta drop to the low bear target for the day at 512.85.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tesla Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla is trading near 230.65, with bulls looking to push the price higher. A breakout above 233.49 could signal further strength, with the next target at 235.74. If buying pressure continues, Tesla could test 238.50, with a strong bull session possibly taking it to the high bull target at 239.92.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 230.65 fails to hold, bears may push Tesla lower to 228.45. Continued selling could bring the price down to 226.53. If the selling pressure persists, Tesla may drop further, with the low bear target set at 223.98 for today&rsquo;s session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Word: Today&#39;s trading session begins relatively quietly, with traders watching for key events later in the week such as the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday and Triple Witching on Friday. Traders should keep an eye on the Empire Manufacturing data for September, due at 8:30 AM ET today, as it could offer early market direction. Later in the day, at 11:30 AM ET, the Treasury will conduct a 3-month and 6-month Bill Auction, which could impact short-term rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no major economic releases today, we may see more positional trading as market participants prepare for the larger catalysts later in the week. The quiet start provides an opportunity for traders to fine-tune their strategies and focus on technical levels. Use today to assess market sentiment ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC meeting and Friday&rsquo;s Triple Witching, both of which are expected to bring heightened volatility.

From his note:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>&hellip;The growth of artificial immersive entertainment may also boost demand for experiences in the real world. This might reflect the growing popularity of goods and services that are seen as &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; or nostalgic. Retro &lsquo;crafts&rsquo; are growing in popularity, whether it be the growth reality TV programmes where contestants compete in baking, spelling, sowing or even ballroom dancing competitions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>These fashions are spreading into retail. According to Grand View Research, for example, the market for so-called &lsquo;artisanal&rsquo; bakery products was valued globally at $95.13 billion in 2022 and is likely to grow at a compound rate of 5.7% from 2023 to 2030. The focus on sustainability and interest in the past together create new consumer markets. According to research conducted by GlobalData for ThredUP, a US second-hand store, the resale clothes market is growing at 15 times the rate of traditional retail. According to a report by Statistica, as of 2021, 42% of millennials and Gen Z respondents stated that they were likely to shop for second-hand items.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>You might assume the broad uptake of the wide array of ridesharing options means demand for modes of transport that you own would fall apart. That&rsquo;s not been the case. From the note:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>A similar trend has emerged in transport with the growth in the &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; economy and the growth of cycle, scooter and car sharing. Few would have predicted the steady growth in the bicycle market a decade ago; the global bicycle market was valued at over $64 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound rate of 9.7% from 2023 to 2030. Perhaps even more striking is how the bicycle is outselling the car. Analysis of 30 European countries by the Confederation of the European Bicycle Industry (CONEBI) and the European Cyclists Federation (ECF) suggests that, at the current trajectory, 10 million more bikes will be sold per year in Europe by 2030, representing a rise of 47% compared with 2019. On this basis, the 30 million bikes sold annually in Europe would be more than double the annual sales of cars.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As the world moves forward, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about the value consumers place on the past. From the note:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>In the 21st century, in a highly digitalised world where almost everyone is connected to the internet and the cutting edge of technology threatens to displace jobs and companies, it is meaningful that one of the biggest companies in Europe is LVMH. This is a company that sells the value of heritage in historic brands. It was formed in 1987 through the merger of two old companies: Louis Vuitton (founded in 1854) and Moet Hennessey, which itself was a merger in 1971 between Moet &amp; Chandon, the champagne producer (founded in 1743) and Hennessey, producer of cognac (founded in 1765). According to its website, the company develops the brands that &lsquo;perfectly encapsulate all that they have embodied for our customers for centuries.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Intangible value is a kind of value. And people are finding it in goods and services that have arguably been improved on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to explain why we value this stuff. But the point is we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we demand this stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when enough people demand something, there&rsquo;ll be businesses to supply that thing. It&rsquo;s just basic economics and capitalism at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A version of this post was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.tker.co/p/ai-technology-demand-for-authentic-nostalgia?publication_id=26696&amp;post_id=148643687&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=2dvdoy&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Tker.co.</a></p>\r\n", "created_at": "2024-09-16T14:38:29Z", "headline": "How Capitalism Will Keep AI From Destroying The Things We Love", "id": 40880240, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/nahrizul-kadri-oasf0qmrwla-unsplash.jpg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/nahrizul-kadri-oasf0qmrwla-unsplash.jpg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/nahrizul-kadri-oasf0qmrwla-unsplash.jpg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Artificial intelligence\u00a0(AI) is\u00a0white hot\u00a0right now.\u00a0Companies everywhere\u00a0are bullish on the promise of taking mountai", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T14:38:31Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/tech/24/09/40880240/how-capitalism-will-keep-ai-from-destroying-the-things-we-love"}

With the U.S. annual inflation rate dropping to 2.5% in August 2024, here&#8217;s how lower rates could help cannabis companies grow:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Lower Borrowing Costs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With inflation cooling and the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/09/40812986/inflation-slows-to-2-5-in-august-lowest-rate-since-february-2021-core-index-remai\">interest rate cuts</a>, cannabis companies could see reduced borrowing costs. This is especially important for an industry reliant on debt due to limited access to traditional banking. Reduced interest payments free up capital for expansion and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Get Benzinga's exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

You can&#8217;t afford to miss out if you're serious about the business.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Easier Access To Financing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As inflation drops, so do the barriers to financing. Affordable loans would become more accessible for cannabis businesses, many of which have struggled to secure traditional funding. Easier financing options will support business growth and scaling in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Increased Investor Interest</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lower interest rates tend to push investors toward high-risk assets like stocks. With inflation down to 2.5%, cannabis stocks, already considered risky, may attract more attention. This could boost stock prices and increase market activity for publicly traded cannabis companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>Opportunities For Expansion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With inflation declining, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39421104/the-banking-crisis-for-cannabis-has-been-over-for-several-years-experts-discuss-whats-next\">borrowing becomes cheaper</a>, which could drive real estate investments. Cannabis companies looking to expand their cultivation and retail operations could benefit from more favorable property loans, stimulating industry growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. <strong>Stronger Consumer Spending</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As inflation stabilizes, consumer purchasing power rises. Rate cuts that stimulate the economy could lead to increased disposable income, boosting sales of cannabis products as discretionary spending grows. The August CPI report shows a 0.2% monthly increase, keeping the economy steady, which could support consumer demand for cannabis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40866871/are-investors-missing-the-forest-35-stock-drop-masks-the-international-potential-of\">Are Investors Missing The Forest? 35% Stock Drop Masks The International Potential Of This Weed Company</a></strong></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T14:38:33Z", "headline": "5 Reasons Why Lower Interest Rates Could Boost The Cannabis Industry", "id": 40880241, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/AI-Generated-Image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/AI-Generated-Image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/AI-Generated-Image_0.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "With the U.S. annual inflation rate dropping to 2.5% in August 2024, here&#39;s how lower rates could help cannabis companies grow.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T14:38:34Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40880241/5-reasons-why-lower-interest-rates-could-boost-the-cannabis-industry"}

{"author": "Viridian Capital Advisors", "content": "<p>The cannabis debt market is HOT! The five issues shown on the chart were all completed in the third quarter of 2024 (with two weeks remaining) and account for approximately $632M of proceeds, greater than any quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img alt=\"untitled_design_22.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/September/16/untitled_design_22.png\" style=\"height:549px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graph shows the effective cost of the transaction on the vertical axis with the Viridian Credit Ranking at the time of the transaction on the horizontal axis. The close fit of the regression line (R-squared of .91) shows that the market is accurately taking into account the credit risk of the issuers in its pricing of new issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most significant outlier is the&nbsp;12.75% cost for TerrAscend, which we had expected to carry a higher yield. TSND&#39;s less-than-stellar credit ranking was partially attributable to the liquidity pressures that the new financing alleviated. The company is currently ranked three notches better at #11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jushi (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/JUSHF#OTC\">JUSHF</a>) transaction was for first-priority notes, which are now quoted at closer to 17%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the deals on the chart represent refinancings of existing debt. An additional $114M of refinancings occurred earlier in the year for AYR (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AYRWF#OTC\">AYRWF</a>), PharmaCann (Private), and Cannabist (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CBSTF#OTC\">CBSTF</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant growth capital debt deals have also closed for private companies, including a $40M Sunburn deal and $20M for Nova.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week&#39;s Acreage (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ACRDF#OTC\">ACRDF</a>) refinancing demonstrates that investor demand exists for companies across the credit quality spectrum. Viridian ranks Acreage at #28/31 due to its extremely high (14.5x) total liabilities to market cap and total liabilities to assets (1.6x). However, we expect the additional liquidity provided by the transaction may improve the company&#39;s ranking somewhat in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With cannabis equity markets range-bound and skeptical, awaiting S3 or further developments on SAFE, the debt market is thankfully continuing to be the principal capital source for the cultivation and retail sector for both squeaky clean credits like Green Thumb (GTII: CSE) as well as more challenging underwritings like Jushi and Acreage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Viridian Capital Chart of the Week highlights key investment, valuation and M&amp;A trends taken from the Viridian Cannabis Deal Tracker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://viridianca.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=078ead34a8bbcfd77b0486326&amp;id=c89a19f9ee&amp;e=2699f9b787\">Viridian Cannabis Deal Tracker</a> provides the market intelligence that cannabis companies, investors, and acquirers utilize to make informed decisions regarding capital allocation and M&amp;A strategy.

{"author": "Dylan Berman", "content": "<p><strong>Intel Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\">INTC</a>) shares are trading higher on Monday after Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-13/intel-solidifies-3-5-billion-deal-to-make-chips-for-us-military\">reported</a> that the company qualifies for up to $3.5 billion in federal grants to produce semiconductors for the Pentagon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The company has faced competition from other chipmakers in seeking these funds and concerns regarding relying on one company for the Pentagon&#8217;s needs. Although Intel is likely to be awarded the grants, it has not yet officially been awarded to the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The money would add to the possible $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in loans that the company was previously awarded under the Chips and Science Act. Intel is still in the progress of negotiating this package and has not yet received the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The money would support Intel&#8217;s facilities in variety of states, including Arizona and Ohio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential new grants would come from a program entitled Secret Enclave, also funded by the Chips and Science Act, which seeks to secure production of advanced chips for military and intelligence purposes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How To Buy Intel Shares</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share &#8211; or fractional share &#8211; of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Intel (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\">INTC</a>)'s case, it is in the Information Technology sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/09/40868730/openais-o1-model-nvidias-ai-demand-googles-missed-opportunity-and-more-this-week-in-ai\">OpenAI&#8217;s &#8216;O1&#8217; Model, Nvidia&#8217;s AI Demand, Google&#8217;s Missed Opportunity, And More: This Week In AI</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>INTC Price Action:</strong> At the time of writing, Intel stock is moving 4.17% higher at $20.48, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Photo via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T14:56:30Z", "headline": "What's Going On With Intel Stock Monday?", "id": 40880571, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/untitled_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/untitled_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/untitled_1.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Intel shares are trading higher on Monday after it was announced that the company qualifies for up to $3.5 billion in federal grants to produce semiconductors for the Pentagon.", "symbols": ["INTC"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T14:56:30Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40880571/whats-going-on-with-intel-stock-monday"}

significantly falling below the industry average by <b>0.38x</b>, it suggests undervaluation and the possibility of untapped growth prospects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of <b>13.12</b>, which is <b>1.39x</b> the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a Return on Equity (ROE) of <b>8.45%</b> that is <b>40.61%</b> below the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits potential inefficiency in utilizing equity to generate profits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of <b>$34.33 Billion</b>, which is <b>57.22x</b> above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company has higher gross profit of <b>$45.04 Billion</b>, which indicates <b>34.38x</b> above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a revenue growth of <b>15.2%</b>, which surpasses the industry average of <b>11.1%</b>, the company is

alt=\"debt to equity\" /></p>\n\n<p>The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company.</p>\n<p>Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Microsoft can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Microsoft exhibits a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers in the sector, as indicated by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of <b>0.25</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This suggests that the company has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be seen as a positive aspect for investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>For Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB ratio is also low, suggesting a possible bargain opportunity. However, the PS ratio is high, signaling rich valuation based on revenue. In terms of ROE, Microsoft shows lower profitability compared to peers. The high EBITDA and gross profit levels reflect strong operational performance, while the high revenue growth indicates robust top-line expansion.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T15:00:12Z", "headline": "Comparative Study: Microsoft And Industry Competitors In Software Industry", "id": 40880643, "images": [], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["MSFT"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T15:00:13Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/news/24/09/40880643/comparative-study-microsoft-and-industry-competitors-in-software-industry"}

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; </strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

{"author": "Khyathi Dalal", "content": "<p>Pseudonymous crypto influencer Sistine Research shared three self-proclaimed &#8220;contrarian takes&#8221; on the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/dogecoin-doge-price-prediction\">future of certain cryptocurrencies</a>, including <strong>Ripple</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/xrp/usd\">XRP</a>), <strong>Ethereum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>) and the <strong>Maga Memecoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">TRUMP</a>) token.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The influencer outlined their belief that XRP, the digital currency associated with Ripple, is currently undervalued. They predict that it will outperform most major cryptocurrencies over the next 12-24 months as the ongoing SEC case resolves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst also <a href=\"https://x.com/sistineresearch/status/1834650157943521583\">expects</a> Ethereum to start outperforming soon, as the attractiveness of DeFi increases with the Federal Reserve cutting rates and yields dropping. They believe more money will move on-chain and into DeFi, favouring ETH, <strong>Aave </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/aave/usd\">AAVE</a>), <strong>Uniswap </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/uni/usd\">UNI</a>), <strong>Lido Dao</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">LDO</a>) <strong>Pepe</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">PEPE</a>), and TRUMP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sistine Research also sees value in the TRUMP token. They argue that the market currently believes there is a 49% chance of a Trump election win (based on Polymarket <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1726494753468\">data</a>), which could lead to a significant increase in the value of the meme coin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Trump wins, they expect the crypto market to surge on the likelihood of a <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) strategic reserve getting priced in. However, TRUMP has lost over 90% of its value from the all-time high. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27091545/Benzinga-conference.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga future of digital assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-267246\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40859365/ouch-harris-trump-themed-political-meme-coins-down-90-what-happened-to-4-more-years-of-cat\">Ouch! Harris, Trump-Themed Political Meme Coins Down 90%: What Happened To &#8216;4 More Years Of Catalysts&#8217;?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Sistine Research&#8217;s views provide a contrarian perspective, suggesting potential opportunities for investors willing to take on more risk. The forecast for XRP is particularly notable given the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/07/39667693/crypto-regulation-sparks-legal-spats-ripple-sec-and-pending-s-1-approvals-in-focus\">legal battle between Ripple</a> and the SEC, which has created uncertainty around the digital currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prediction for Ethereum and the associated DeFi tokens suggests a shift in the market dynamics as traditional financial mechanisms adjust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the TRUMP token continues to sell off due to fears of a loss in the upcoming election, its market cap could drop to $30-$100 million (currently $92.4 million). At this lower valuation, the token would have widespread distribution, fewer large holders (&#8220;whales&#8221;) and benefit from strong crypto market conditions and significant media attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, if Ethereum rises to $3,000-$4,000 pre-election, the TRUMP token could also rally, as it has closely followed ETH's performance throughout the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong>: The influence of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin as an institutional asset class</a>&nbsp;is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga&#8217;s upcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Future of Digital Assets</a>&nbsp;event on Nov. 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40860002/heres-how-much-donald-trumps-crypto-portfolio-is-down-from-the-top-spoiler-its-millions-an\">Here&#8217;s How Much Donald Trump&#8217;s Crypto Portfolio Is Down From The Top (Spoiler: It&#8217;s Millions And Millions Of Dollars)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ", "created_at": "2024-09-16T15:17:07Z", "headline": "Trader Shares '3 Contrarian Takes:' TRUMP Meme Coin 'An Obvious Buy' And These 2 Cryptos Are 'Deep Value' And Will Be 'Outperforming Soon'", "id": 40881260, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Il-piano-crypto-di-Trump-per-la-supremaz.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Il-piano-crypto-di-Trump-per-la-supremaz.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Il-piano-crypto-di-Trump-per-la-supremaz.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Pseudonymous crypto influencer Sistine Research shared three self-proclaimed \u201ccontrarian takes\u201d on the future of certain cryptocurrencies, including Ripple (CRYPTO: XRP), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ", "symbols": ["AAVEUSD", "BTCUSD", "ETHUSD", "LDOUSD", "PEPEUSD", "UNIUSD", "XRPUSD"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T15:17:08Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40881260/trader-shares-3-contrarian-takes-trump-meme-coin-an-obvious-buy-and-these-2-cryptos-are-de"}

{"author": "Chris Katje", "content": "<p>Award-winning HBO series \"Succession,\" which centered on a media company's patriarch struggle to find a successor for his company was a work of fiction that was <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/07/33208010/hbo-netflix-apple-and-streaming-dominate-emmy-award-nominations-the-last-of-us-succession-t\">well loved by viewers.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real-life story that inspired the hit show is set to play out in court beginning this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>A battle for control of Fox News and other assets of<strong> Fox Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FOX#NASDAQ\">FOX</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FOXA#NASDAQ\">FOXA</a>) will take center stage in a Nevada trial this week that could impact one of the largest<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/media-stocks\"> publicly traded media companies.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media mogul <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong>, who helped build Fox to what it is today, is seeking to change the succession plan for his company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family trust currently will see Murdoch's children share control of the company when the 93-year-old media mogul passes away, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/15/nx-s1-5113155/murdoch-family-trust-fox-news-succession\">reported </a>by NPR. Murdoch is looking to revise the trust structure to ensure his eldest son, <strong>Lachlan Murdoch</strong>, who currently holds the roles of executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation and chairman of <strong>News Corporation </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NWS#NASDAQ\">NWS</a>), assumes full control of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Murdoch's other children oppose the trust amendment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court battle pitting Murdoch against his children may also spark a dispute over the future direction of Fox News, particularly whether it should remain partisan, as it currently leans toward right-wing viewpoints. Son<strong> James Murdoch</strong> has been critical of Fox News' pro-<strong>Donald Trump</strong> stance in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Lachlan and his father have battled over the years, much like the characters on \"Succession,\" Murdoch now believes that the eldest son could best position Fox and News Corp for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Murdoch set up a family trust that would hand equal share and equal control to his holdings after his death as part of an agreement when he left his second wife <strong>Anna Torv Murdoch Mann</strong>. The trust and a $110 million payout to Murdoch Mann helped the media mogul avoid a fight over his media holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent tensions between Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s children and their father have led to several of them skipping his wedding to his fifth wife, <strong>Elena Zhukova</strong>, earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Murdoch succession court battle is scheduled to begin on Monday and will remain private. A motion by NPR and other media outlets to make the trial public was denied by the probate official. Murdoch and his four oldest children are expected to appear in court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/09/40776084/kendrick-lamar-to-perform-super-bowl-lix-halftime-could-apple-fox-and-universal-music-get-a\">Kendrick Lamar To Perform Super Bowl LIX Halftime: Could Apple, Fox And Universal Music Get A Boost?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important: </strong>A change of Fox News could impact the large media company and take years to recover in viewership and advertising revenue as it charts a new path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"If they were to change the direction and move into the direction of a CNN format, or go down the middle, it will lose its identity, lose viewers and lose revenues,\" former Fox News president <strong>Joe Peyronnin</strong> said, as shared by NPR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Murdoch has pushed for Fox News to be more similar to Sky News in Europe, a media company he previously ran when it was owned by Fox.

The company recently reported that it has <strong>4.90 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 1.9% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 2.46 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>D.R.

Only around 130,000 new medical cannabis prescriptions are written annually, according to Lang, although there are approximately 4 million regular cannabis users in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/australia-cannabis\">Australia </a>must go through the <strong>Therapeutic Goods Association</strong> (TGA) to access cannabis, with the majority of products being imported from Canada and Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legal medical cannabis market in Australia was valued at AUD 136 million ($91.6 million) in 2023, while the illicit market dwarfs this figure, estimated at AUD 5 billion annually.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discrepancy highlights the limited availability and high costs of legal cannabis, making it difficult for patients to switch from illegal suppliers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40323963/australian-cannabis-producers-eye-european-market-especially-germany-and-france-marijuana-and-me\">&nbsp;Australian Cannabis Producers Eye European Market, Especially Germany And France, Marijuana And Menstrual Pain Study Underway</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Barriers To Entry: High Costs And Stringent Regulations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lang emphasized that the biggest challenge for local cultivators in Australia is the stringent regulatory framework. To legally cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis, companies must secure multiple licenses through the TGA, including cultivation, manufacturing and import licenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These licenses are costly and come with rigorous compliance, delaying market entry. \"It's just too onerous, and no one's making money out of it,\" <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-lang-1a531124/?originalSubdomain=au\">Lang</a> said, noting that the market is &#8220;overly competitive&#8221; and dominated by larger companies with the capital to absorb these costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia's favorable climate is offset by regulatory hurdles, requiring millions in upfront investment. In addition, the lack of infrastructure for large-scale cultivation makes it hard for local businesses to compete with imports. &#8220;It's not worth setting up cultivation in Australia right now,&#8221; Lang concluded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Imports Dominate Cannabis In Australia</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Stolk, the majority of medicinal cannabis available in Australia is imported from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/canada-cannabis\">Canada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/israel-cannabis\">Israel</a>. Imported cannabis typically arrives pre-packaged, with patients receiving their prescriptions via telehealth consultations. According to Stolk, this reliance on imports is not only costly but also restricts access to fresher, higher-quality products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Much of the cannabis that comes in through legal channels is up to two years old and irradiated,\" <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/willybiggs/\">Stolk </a>explained, referring to the process used to sterilize cannabis. In addition, the lack of variety in strains has driven many patients to continue purchasing cannabis from the illegal market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40493745/bioxyne-delivers-australias-first-pharmaceutical-cannabis-gummies-scales-up-manufacturing-capabi\">Bioxyne Delivers Australia&#8217;s First Pharmaceutical Cannabis Gummies, Scales Up Manufacturing Capabilities</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Australia's Illegal Market: A $5 Billion Challenge</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Valued at AUD 5 billion, the illegal cannabis trade vastly outpaces the legal market, where prices remain prohibitively high. Patients can pay upwards of AUD 150 for 10 grams of cannabis from a dispensary, compared to AUD 250 for an ounce on the illegal market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The quality of legal cannabis is also questioned, with many products reportedly failing to meet their stated THC levels,\" Lang emphasized.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consumer Trends: A Lagging Market With Room To Grow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia&#8217;s cannabis consumers are less familiar with the variety and quality of products available in more developed markets like California and Canada, but awareness is slowly growing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Stolk, this is reflected in the limited variety of products available <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/cannabis-regulation\">legally</a>, with only a few strains and derivatives, such as bubble hash and rosin, beginning to enter the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The market is 10 to 20 years behind the U.S.,\" Stolk said. As the market evolves and consumers become more educated, there is a clear demand for higher-quality cannabis and a wider variety of products, but the regulatory system currently prevents rapid growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Role Of Big Pharma: A Major Obstacle To Full Legalization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lang and Stolk agree that one of the biggest obstacles to the development of a legal recreational cannabis market in Australia is the influence of big pharmaceutical companies. Lang explained that pharmaceutical companies are some of the largest political donors in Australia and have a vested interest in limiting the growth of the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis/deals\"> cannabis industry</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The pharmaceutical industry views cannabis as a threat, particularly as people increasingly recognize its holistic health benefits,\" Lang said. He believes pharmaceutical companies will likely push for synthetic cannabinoids to dominate the market, further delaying the development of a natural, plant-based cannabis sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40554900/new-zealands-cannabis-legacy-genetics-reach-australian-medical-marijuana-market\">New Zealand&#8217;s Cannabis Legacy Genetics Reach Australian Medical Marijuana Market</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving Forward: Lessons From The U.S. And Canada</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Lang and Stolk emphasized that Australia could learn from the successes and failures of cannabis markets in other countries. Stolk pointed to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/california-cannabis\">California&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit </a>and more open market as a potential model for Australia but also warned against the heavy taxation that has made it difficult for smaller businesses to succeed in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lang believes that Canada's federally regulated cannabis system offers some valuable lessons, particularly in terms of quality control and distribution, but he also notes that the high costs of legal cannabis in Canada have driven many consumers back to the illegal market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No country has gotten it completely right yet,&#8221; Stolk added, but Australia has an opportunity to create a balanced and sustainable market if it addresses the regulatory barriers currently in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39256772/beyond-europe-and-north-america-curaleaf-ceo-on-cannabis-markets-in-australia-new-zealand-and-is\">Beyond Europe And North America: Curaleaf&#8217;s Strategist On Cannabis Markets In Australia, New Zealand, And Israel</a></strong></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T15:49:59Z", "headline": "More Than $3 Billion At Stake: How Regulatory Red Tape Is Holding Back Australia's Cannabis Legalization", "id": 40881984, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/AI-Generated-Image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/AI-Generated-Image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/AI-Generated-Image_1.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "While Australia has legalized medical cannabis, the market is restricted.

The gunman said he has no savings, no real estate and his only assets are two trucks worth $1,000 that are located in Hawaii. Routh also said he sometimes supports a 25-year-old son.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40870455/trump-vows-to-never-surrender-after-surviving-second-assassination-attempt\">Trump Vows To &#8216;Never Surrender&#8217; After Surviving Second Assassination Attempt</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important</strong>: The reported assassination attempt took place at a Florida golf course Sunday, where Trump was golfing. A Secret Service member noticed Routh and fired several warning shots, which prompted the gunman to flee in an SUV. An assault rifle and scope were found, while reports say Routh never fired a shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has pushed back against the Democratic Party, attributing the negativity directed at him as the motivation behind Routh's thwarted assassination attempt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump said Routh \"believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country \u2013 both from the inside and out,\" Trump told Fox News.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports indicate that Routh had previously expressed support for Trump online, but later posted negative comments about him and voiced support for<strong> Joe Biden</strong> and <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not much is known about Routh after the assassination attempt. The Associated Press previously filmed Routh at a demonstration in Kyiv, Ukraine, after Russia invaded the country. Routh held a sign saying Russia's corruption and evil can not be tolerated while participating in the rally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials have said that Routh never served in the Ukrainian army or worked with the country's military. A representative said Routh has contacted the Ukrainian government with \"delusional\" and \"nonsensical ideas\" in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Routh said in a past interview that he was working to recruit foreign fighters in Ukraine after being rejected for volunteering as he was too old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"A lot of other conflicts are grey, but this conflict is definitely black and white. This is about good versus evil,\" Routh said in a video, as reported by Reuters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second attempt on Trump's life in less than two months has brought calls for additional security for the former president. Senator <strong>Rick Scott</strong> said he is proposing legislation to increase security for Trump and other former presidents.

The company recently reported that it has <strong>374 thousand shares sold short</strong>, which is 3.44% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 4.82 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Piper Sandler Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1726503323_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Piper Sandler has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing Piper Sandler's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Piper Sandler's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.27%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T16:15:26Z", "headline": "How Is The Market Feeling About Piper Sandler?", "id": 40882526, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_1.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["PIPR"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T16:15:27Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/short-sellers/24/09/40882526/how-is-the-market-feeling-about-piper-sandler"}

He noted that the company's goal is to support this evolution by creating a platform that integrates tokenized assets into a familiar public market interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40876874/sec-moves-to-amend-binance-lawsuit-reinforcing-claims-of-unregistered-securities-sales\"><strong>SEC Moves To Amend Binance Lawsuit, Reinforcing Claims Of Unregistered Securities Sales</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T16:25:55Z", "headline": "'Ride Regulatory Waves,' Not 'Fight Tsunamis': Prometheum CEO On Navigating Blockchain Regulation", "id": 40882768, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Ethereum-Coin-And-Bitcoin-In-Background-_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Ethereum-Coin-And-Bitcoin-In-Background-_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Ethereum-Coin-And-Bitcoin-In-Background-_0.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Leaders like Aaron Kaplan of Prometheum are preparing for the future of digital assets amid regulatory uncertainty.

This shift is a key indicator of rising investor confidence and the potential for an uptrend in FICO&#8217;s stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 10:19 AM ET on August 29th, AZO registered a Power Inflow at a price of $1868.46. Following this signal, the stock reached its high point at 2:15 EDT, climbing over 19\u00a0points ($1887.89) during the day, translating to an approximate increase of 1.0%. This alert is crucial for investors relying on order flow analytics, suggesting the beginning of an uptrend and presenting a valuable opportunity for those anticipating higher prices. Observers are now closely monitoring FICO for sustained positive momentum, viewing this as a bullish sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Understanding Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Power Inflow is identified by a surge in buy orders over sell orders, typically occurring within the first one or two hours after the market opens. This phenomenon is observed in ten to twenty stocks daily, reflecting the initial strategies and reactions of large institutional investors. Analyzing the size, timing, and price of these transactions helps signal shifts in market sentiment and potential price changes. For those interested in monitoring more stocks exhibiting Power Inflows, visiting the TradePulse website provides comprehensive insights and updates on daily occurrences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power Inflows are crucial as they offer early indications of potential uptrends, enabling traders to act even before the market fully adjusts. Such a change is commonly viewed as a sign of larger inflows than retail is capable of producing, indicating institutional interest and a short-term uptrend in the stock. Although not always marking the lowest point, stocks tend to rise following a Power Inflow. This makes these signals especially valuable for identifying strategic entry points and planning short-term investments, as they provide an opportunity to capitalize on upward momentum ahead of wider market recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strategic Actions Following a Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After detecting a Power Inflow, traders should view it as a potential entry buying point but also confirm the trend with TradePulse's additional indicators such as Momentum, Daily, and Large Deal flows to ensure its strength and viability. Prompt action, combined with strategic stop-loss settings, can maximize returns and minimize risks. This comprehensive approach allows traders to make more informed decisions, optimizing their trading strategies in alignment with real-time market dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to stay updated on the latest options trades for <strong>Fair Isaac Corp.</strong>,<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\"> Benzinga Pro</a> gives you real-time options trade alerts.\u00a0<a href=\"https://benzinga.com/apis?_gl=1&#x2A;1hlgn5i&#x2A;_ga&#x2A;MTY1NjE2NTYxMi4xNzE0NzQ4MTAy&#x2A;_ga_V7ZK73W7N0&#x2A;MTcxNDc0ODEwMi4xLjEuMTcxNDc0ODQyOC4wLjAuMA..\">Market News and Data are brought to you by Benzinga APIs</a> and include firms, like<a href=\"https://finitusa.com/en/\"> Finit USA</a>, responsible for parts of the data within this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://benzinga.com/apis?_gl=1&#x2A;1hlgn5i&#x2A;_ga&#x2A;MTY1NjE2NTYxMi4xNzE0NzQ4MTAy&#x2A;_ga_V7ZK73W7N0&#x2A;MTcxNDc0ODEwMi4xLjEuMTcxNDc0ODQyOC4wLjAuMA..\">Market News and Data are brought to you by Benzinga APIs</a> and include firms, like<a href=\"https://finitusa.com/en/\"> Finit USA</a>, responsible for parts of the data within this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>After Market Close UPDATE</em>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price at the time of the Power Inflow was <strong>$1868.46.</strong> The returns on the High price (<strong>$1887.87</strong>) and Close price (<strong>$1868.84)</strong> after the Power Inflow were respectively <strong>1.0% and 0.0%.

(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AZO#NYSE\">AZO</a>), signaling a shift from net selling to buying. This shift is a key indicator of rising investor confidence and the potential for an uptrend in AZO&#8217;s stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Understanding Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Power Inflow is identified by a surge in buy orders over sell orders, typically occurring within the first one or two hours after the market opens. This phenomenon is observed in ten to twenty stocks daily, reflecting the initial strategies and reactions of large institutional investors. Analyzing the size, timing, and price of these transactions helps signal shifts in market sentiment and potential price changes. For those interested in monitoring more stocks exhibiting Power Inflows, visiting the TradePulse website provides comprehensive insights and updates on daily occurrences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power Inflows are crucial as they offer early indications of potential uptrends, enabling traders to act even before the market fully adjusts. Such a change is commonly viewed as a sign of larger inflows than retail is capable of producing, indicating institutional interest and a short-term uptrend in the stock. Although not always marking the lowest point, stocks tend to rise following a Power Inflow. This makes these signals especially valuable for identifying strategic entry points and planning short-term investments, as they provide an opportunity to capitalize on upward momentum ahead of wider market recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strategic Actions Following a Power Inflow:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After detecting a Power Inflow, traders should view it as a potential entry buying point but also confirm the trend with TradePulse's additional indicators such as Momentum, Daily, and Large Deal flows to ensure its strength and viability. Prompt action, combined with strategic stop-loss settings, can maximize returns and minimize risks. This comprehensive approach allows traders to make more informed decisions, optimizing their trading strategies in alignment with real-time market dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to stay updated on the latest options trades for <strong>Autozone </strong><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\"><strong>Inc</strong>.</span>,<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\"> Benzinga Pro</a> gives you real-time options trade alerts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.com/apis?_gl=1&#x2A;1hlgn5i&#x2A;_ga&#x2A;MTY1NjE2NTYxMi4xNzE0NzQ4MTAy&#x2A;_ga_V7ZK73W7N0&#x2A;MTcxNDc0ODEwMi4xLjEuMTcxNDc0ODQyOC4wLjAuMA..\">Market News and Data are brought to you by Benzinga APIs</a> and include firms, like<a href=\"https://finitusa.com/en/\"> Finit USA</a>, responsible for parts of the data within this article.</p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T16:34:45Z", "headline": "Tradepulse Power Inflow Alert: Autozone Inc.

We don't want to be involved in politics in any way.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Yardeni indicates that some members of the FOMC may not be entirely indifferent to the political landscape, especially given former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8216;s contentious relationship with the Fed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yardeni speculates, &#8220;some members of the FOMC strongly dislike Donald Trump,&#8221; particularly since Trump is more likely than Harris to challenge the Fed&#8217;s independence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an aggregation of the latest polls conducted in September, <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> holds an average lead of slightly more than 2 percentage points over Trump, standing at 48.8% compared to Trump&#8217;s 46.35%, with 4.85% of voters still undecided. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Betting odds tracked by Polymarket show a tight race, with Harris assigned a 50% chance of winning and Trump at 49%. This narrow margin makes any economic changes between now and Election Day crucial in swaying undecided voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Powell factor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yardeni also hints at Powell&#8217;s personal motivations, noting that his term as Fed Chair expires on May 15, 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Trump wins re-election, the likelihood of Powell being reappointed seems low. In contrast, if Harris wins, Powell might have a shot at retaining his role, though a more liberal candidate like <strong>Lael Brainard</strong> could also be in contention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yardeni highlights Powell&#8217;s recent shift from &#8220;inflation hawk to employment dove&#8221; at the August Jackson Hole symposium, suggesting this may be part of a strategy to align with political winds that favor his reappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40870498/americans-falling-behind-on-their-bills-mohamed-el-erian-echoes-worries-as-rate-cut-buzz-grows-loude\">Americans Falling Behind On Their Bills: Mohamed El-Erian Echoes Worries As Rate Cut Buzz Grows Louder</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T16:51:37Z", "headline": "Elizabeth Warren Urges Fed To Slash Rates By 0.75%; Veteran Investor Warns Even 0.5% Cut Could 'Reduce Trump's Chances Of Winning'", "id": 40883274, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/untitled_5.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/untitled_5.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/untitled_5.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "The Fed&#39;s rate decision on Sept. 18 is uncertain, with debate over a 0.25% or 0.5% cut. 3 Senators urge a 75 bps cut, citing recession risk.

{"author": "Franca Quarneti", "content": "<p><strong>Sony Group Corp</strong>'s (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SONY#NYSE\">SONY</a>) newly appointed joint CEO <strong>Hideaki Nishino</strong> reaffirmed that consoles will continue to be &#8220;core&#8221; to the company's gaming strategy, even as it expands into <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/24/07/39966966/playstation-vr2-expands-to-pc-in-august-with-new-steam-app\">other platforms.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC105XT0Q4A910C2000000/\">interview </a>with Japanese publication Nikkei, Nishino, who heads Sony's Platform Business Group, made it clear that while the company is broadening its reach to include more PC titles, PlayStation hardware will remain a critical part of its business model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/24/08/40635576/leak-reveals-key-details-about-the-ps5-pro-what-we-know-so-far\"> PS5 Pro Leak Reveals Key Details: What We Know So Far</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Power of PlayStation Consoles</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>During the interview, Nishino discussed what sets PlayStation apart from the competition in a crowded gaming market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I think that with mobile devices, there are many games that show advertisements, and PCs are difficult to set up, but with PlayStation, once you turn it on, you can experience the content you bought straight away,\" he said (<a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstations-co-ceo-insists-consoles-will-remain-the-core-of-its-business/\">translated</a> by VGC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nishino also praised the PlayStation Store, describing it as an intuitive marketplace where games and other software are laid out in a way that simplifies purchasing for users. According to him, this seamless process contributes significantly to the PlayStation console's appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While PlayStation consoles remain at the heart of Sony's gaming strategy, Nishino confirmed that the company is working hard to develop content for other platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"There is no doubt that consoles will be at the core of our business, but by offering titles for platforms other than consoles, we will reach a wider range of customers,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Balancing Live-Service and Blockbuster Games</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Sony executive Hermen Hulst provided additional insights into the company's direction. Hulst said live-service games such as Helldivers 2 and Concord would be released simultaneously on PlayStation and PC. However, Sony's blockbuster, narrative-driven titles will still launch on PlayStation consoles first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We introduce our great franchises to new audiences, and we're finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing, for example, sequels on the PlayStation platform,\" Hulst said. </p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro Announced for November</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Sony also recently confirmed that the PlayStation 5 Pro, a highly anticipated upgrade to the current PS5 model, will be released on Nov. 7.

The firm has traditionally avoided live programming or sports content, instead focusing on on-demand access to episodic television, movies, and documentaries.

The lawsuit alleges that the Nebraska Secretary of State&#8217;s office did not provide sufficient time to review and challenge the petition, which Kuehn claims includes \"numerous signatures\" that should be disqualified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuehn's lawsuit, filed just one day before the measures were certified, calls for the invalidation of signatures on both petitions, which he argues could undermine the integrity of the certification process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Allegations Of Signature Fraud</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Compounding the controversy, <strong>Michael Egbert</strong>, a Grand Island man involved in gathering signatures for the petition, was charged with falsifying signatures. As <a href=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/09/13/nebraska-ag-announces-investigation-into-several-thousand-signatures-on-2024-petitions/\">reported</a> by the Nebraska Examiner, prosecutors allege that Egbert submitted signatures from deceased residents, as well as signatures with incorrect information, such as misspelled names and inaccurate dates of birth. Egbert is accused of lying in the affidavit of a circulator on a petition,and his arraignment is set for October 2, weeks before the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"NMM provides extensive training to all petition circulators. Circulators are held to an extremely high standard and are required to strictly follow all legal requirements for collecting signatures.

(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/OKTA#NASDAQ\">OKTA</a>)\u00a0faced a data breach in early 2022 and a group of hackers obtained sensitive customer data. However, Okta did not disclose the details of the incident on time. When the management finally decided to reveal the extent of this breach to the public, there was a lack of transparency regarding the depth of this issue and the company&#8217;s security measures. Following these events, in May 2022, a group of shareholders sued Okta for providing misleading statements, negligence, and omissions. On July 19, 2024, nearly two years later, Okta agreed to pay $60 million to affected shareholders to settle this lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Okta Has Itself to Blame for The Investor Backlash</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The roots of the scandal, which eventually led to the lawsuit, trace back to Okta's acquisition and integration of Auth0. In May 2021, Okta acquired Auth0, Inc. for $6.5 billion. Auth0 is a company that provides customer identity and access management software. Following the acquisition of Auth0, the business integration of the two companies faced a major blow as there were severe difficulties in combining both sales divisions. Not long after the acquisition, several senior leaders from Auth0 and Okta left the company too, affecting the business. This turnover affected Okta's operations, however, the management avoided disclosing these issues to investors, potentially keeping investors in the dark about the challenges Okta faced following this multi-billion-dollar transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"936\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203246/Okta_Auth0.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1244\" srcset=\"https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203246/Okta_Auth0.png 936w,https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203246/Okta_Auth0-300x110.png 300w,https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203246/Okta_Auth0-768x282.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: Investor presentation</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid these challenges, Okta faced a data security incident in January 2022. Okta allegedly failed to secure its administrative tools, particularly the &#8220;SuperUser tool&#8221;, which allowed access to customer data without proper vetting or security measures. Employees without formal training could reportedly access customer data even with their home laptops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Okta failed to enforce its &#8220;Zero Trust&#8221; security standards on third-party vendors, leading to critical vulnerabilities exploited by hackers from the group LAPSUS$ in January 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LAPSUS$ posted the following message on their Telegram channel, confirming they have access to Okta's systems. One such screenshot posted by LAPSUS$ revealed that they had access to the Cloudflare tenant with the ability to even reset employee passwords, which highlights the gravity of the data breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"788\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203457/LAPSUS_-message.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1245\" style=\"width:550px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203457/LAPSUS_-message.jpg 788w,https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203457/LAPSUS_-message-290x300.jpg 290w,https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13203457/LAPSUS_-message-768x795.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: Bleeping Computer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Okta denied the news, stating that the service had not been breached and remained fully operational while a third party made an \"unsuccessful attempt\" to breach the systems. However, Okta's attempts to minimize that bad news soon escalated into a public relations nightmare, leading to stock downgrades, senior management apologies, and a class action lawsuit after the company publicly accepted the data breach on Twitter on March 22, 2022, more than two months after the breach occurred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"594\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13204359/CEO-message-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1250\" srcset=\"https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13204359/CEO-message-1.png 594w,https://contributor-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/13204359/CEO-message-1-300x273.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: X</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company faced severe consequences following CEO Todd McKinnon&#8217;s Twitter post. Not long after, CSO David Bradbury reported in an official statement that around 2.5% of the customers might have been affected by the breach. These events deteriorated investor trust in Okta, eventually leading to an 11% decline in stock price on March 23, 2022. These events eventually wiped off $6 billion from the company's market value within just a week of the company's acknowledgment of the data breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of these developments, Raymond James downgraded Okta and wrote in a note to clients:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p></p>\n<cite>&#8220;While partners were willing to trust Okta's track record, the handling of its latest security incident adds to our mounting concerns.&#8221;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The situation worsened in May 2022 when a group of shareholders sued Okta, accusing the company of failing to share details about the security breach. They also claimed Okta didn't take enough steps to prevent the breach and delayed revealing it while downplaying its vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in October 2023, Okta experienced another data breach on its customer support system, causing the stock to fall by 12%. The breach was made through a stolen credential, which enabled hackers to log into the support case management system. The following month, the management stated that the attackers stole information about all users from the support system, including client names and email addresses. Even though there is no direct evidence of misuse of the stolen information, Okta asked customers to be cautioned, stating that such data could be perilous in facilitating phishing and social engineering attempts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid these security threats and litigation issues, Okta stock has declined 35% in the last 5 years despite its revenue increasing substantially from just $399 million in 2019 to $2.26 billion in 2023.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Resolving The Case</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okta has agreed to pay $60 million to settle claims related to the security breach and shareholder lawsuit. If you invested in Okta in 2022, you may be eligible to claim part of the <a href=\"https://11thestate.com/cases/okta-investor-settlement\">settlement</a> to recover some of your losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The settlement and the broader security breach issues underscore the serious legal and financial risks of not prioritizing transparency and cybersecurity, as <a href=\"https://www.dandodiary.com/2022/05/articles/securities-litigation/cybersecurity-firm-hit-with-data-breach-related-securities-suit/\">Kevin LaCroix</a> from RT ProExec noted. For top management, the lawsuit sends a clear message: legal challenges can be handled, but restoring lost trust is a much tougher battle.</p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T17:28:02Z", "headline": "Okta's Costly Cyber Security Failures: A $60 Million Lesson in Transparency", "id": 40884059, "images": [], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["OKTA"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T17:28:02Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/opinion/24/09/40884059/oktas-costly-cyber-security-failures-a-60-million-lesson-in-transparency"}

Adjusted&nbsp;profit is expected to range between $4.63 and $4.68 per share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adobe continues to empower its users with the technology of tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the third quarter, Adobe outperformed across its key business segmens. More importantly, Adobe continues to integrarte AI across its portfolio.&nbsp;AI-powered enhancements, particularly Adobe Firefly,&nbsp;fueled the increased customer engagement and retention across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. However, the lighter than expected forecast sparked fears that AI gains will take longer to monetize, especially in the pressured&nbsp;buying environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

According to statistics and probability theory, 95% of all trading should be within two standard deviations of the mean or average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important concept for traders to understand because many trading algorithms and strategies are based on statistics and probability theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this threshold exceeds to the upside, a stock would be considered Overbought.

This level was resistance and in the financial markets, it's common for a price level that had been resistance to convert into a support level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happens because of trading psychology. It is due to seller's remorse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some traders and investors who sold Arm Holdings while it was at the resistance thought they made the right decision when the price trended lower after. But then the sell-off ended and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/ARM\">Arm Holdings</a> moved above the resistance level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happened, a number of traders and investors who sold at the resistance thought they made a mistake. Many decided to buy their shares back if they could purchase them for the same price they were sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means if the stock falls back to $163, these remorseful sellers will be placing buy orders.

So, you got to essentially hold it or huddle it\u2026to really capture the gains,&#8221; Lee said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years later, Lee <a href=\"https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1833891772272926806\">pointed out</a> in a recent interview on Facts vs Feelings, reported by media company TFTC, that this allocation would now make up around 40% of someone's portfolio due to Bitcoin&#8217;s significant price increase. His advice is still to invest 0.5% in Bitcoin and 0.5% in <strong>Ethereum </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee highlighted two key variables that explained 90% of Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement: Bitcoin wallets and activity providers. These factors led to a projection of Bitcoin reaching $25,000 by 2022, a 5x gain. While these variables hold good even now, Lee also added that predictions from <strong>Michael Saylor</strong> that Bitcoin could hit <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/07/40007277/if-michael-saylors-13m-forecast-for-bitcoin-in-2045-comes-true-btc-market-cap-will-be-bigg#:~:text=%2C%20predicted%20that%20King%20Crypto%20will,nearly%207%25%20of%20global%20wealth.\">$13 million</a> are still in play.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29155259/905735A6-57D3-4874-9AA1-75D037842DB3-2.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-270548\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40814838/bitcoin-gearing-up-for-next-bull-run-on-chain-analysis-says-it-just-might-be\">Bitcoin Gearing Up For Next Bull Run?

The remainder comes from other services, including FedEx Office, which provides document production/shipping, and FedEx Logistics, which provides global forwarding. FedEx acquired Dutch parcel delivery firm TNT Express in 2016, boosting the firm's presence across Europe.

From toys and games to television programming, motion pictures, and a licensing program, Hasbro reaches customers by leveraging its well-known brands such as Transformers, Nerf, and Magic: The Gathering. Ownership stakes in Discovery Family, which offers programming around Hasbro brands, and production capabilities has helped bolster Hasbro's multichannel presence. The firm acquired EOne in 2019, bolting on popular family properties like Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, and since has pruned noncore lines from the tie-up. Furthermore, the addition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Beyond in 2022, offers the firm access to 18 million digital tabletop players.</p>\n<h3>Key Indicators: Hasbro's Financial Health</h3>\n<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> Boasting an elevated market capitalization, the company surpasses industry averages. This signals substantial size and strong market recognition.</p>\n<p><strong>Decline in Revenue:</strong> Over the 3 months period, Hasbro faced challenges, resulting in a decline of approximately <strong>-17.74%</strong> in revenue growth as of 30 June, 2024. This signifies a reduction in the company's top-line earnings. As compared to competitors, the company encountered difficulties, with a growth rate lower than the average among peers in the Consumer Discretionary sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Margin:</strong> The company's net margin is a standout performer, exceeding industry averages. With an impressive net margin of <strong>13.92%,</strong> the company showcases strong profitability and effective cost control.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Hasbro's ROE excels beyond industry benchmarks, reaching <strong>12.84%</strong>. This signifies robust financial management and efficient use of shareholder equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Hasbro's ROA stands out, surpassing industry averages. With an impressive ROA of <strong>2.12%</strong>, the company demonstrates effective utilization of assets and strong financial performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Debt Management:</strong> With a high debt-to-equity ratio of <strong>3.47</strong>, Hasbro faces challenges in effectively managing its debt levels, indicating potential financial strain.</p>\n<h2>Analyst Ratings: Simplified</h2>\n<p>Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions.</p>\n<p>Analysts may supplement their ratings with predictions for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue, offering investors a more comprehensive outlook. However, investors should be mindful that analysts, like any human, can have subjective perspectives influencing their forecasts.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T19:00:15Z", "headline": "A Closer Look at 5 Analyst Recommendations For Hasbro", "id": 40885404, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["HAS"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T19:00:15Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/analyst-ratings/24/09/40885404/a-closer-look-at-5-analyst-recommendations-for-hasbro"}

He <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1835631752611578063\">suggested</a> that Bitcoin might be headed towards a retest of longer-term support at $15,000\u2013$20,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another tweet, Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as being digital gold or even digital silver.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Silver just broke above $31 as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> broke below $59K.

Meanwhile, With Bitcoin trading at $58,400, its total market capitalization is $1.1 trillion. Schiff <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1834308989116710949\">concluded</a>, \"Gold&#8217;s 2024 market cap gain is already 5x Bitcoin&#8217;s total market cap.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, Schiff criticized investors for choosing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-spot-bitcoin-etfs\">Bitcoin ETFs</a> over <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/gold-eft\">gold ETFs</a>, stating they \"bet on the wrong horse\".

His skepticism towards Bitcoin is well-known, with him previously arguing that the leading cryptocurrency <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40818582/gold-bull-peter-schiff-claims-bitcoin-lacks-intrinsic-value-and-is-destined-to-fail\">lacks intrinsic value</a> and is destined to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His views are supported by recent market trends, with on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant pointing out a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40858231/bitcoin-decouples-from-gold-investors-leaning-towards-traditional-safe-haven-assets-crypto#:~:text=What%20Happened%3A%20The%20analytics%20firm,safe%2Dhaven%20assets%20like%20gold.\">negative correlation</a> between Bitcoin and gold. As gold prices hit record highs, Bitcoin prices have been on a downward trend, suggesting a market leaning towards traditional safe-haven assets like gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Schiff&#8217;s views are controversial, they highlight the ongoing debate on the viability of digital currencies and their place in the investment landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong>: The influence of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin as an institutional asset class</a>&nbsp;is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga&#8217;s upcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Future of Digital Assets</a>&nbsp;event on Nov. 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40818582/gold-bull-peter-schiff-claims-bitcoin-lacks-intrinsic-value-and-is-destined-to-fail\">&#8216;Gold Bull&#8217; Peter Schiff Claims Bitcoin &#8216;Lacks Intrinsic Value And Is Destined To Fail&#8217;</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ", "created_at": "2024-09-16T19:44:21Z", "headline": "Peter Schiff: Bitcoin Is Not 'Digital Gold' And Not Even 'Digital Silver' Because Gold's 2024 Gains Alone Are 5X BTC's Market Cap", "id": 40886046, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Peter-Schiff.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Peter-Schiff.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/Peter-Schiff.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Economist and Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff predicts a significant drop in Bitcoin&#39;s (CRYPTO: BTC) value as silver and gold prices soar, sparking a fresh debate on the viability of digital currencies.", "symbols": ["BTCUSD"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T19:44:22Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40886046/peter-schiff-bitcoin-is-not-digital-gold-and-not-even-digital-silver-because-golds-2024-ga"}

Tesla is at the top of the list with 19% while<strong> Volkswagen </strong>(OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VWAPY#OTC\">VWAPY</a>) is number five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pairing foreign companies with local manufacturers has allowed the Chinese industry to gain the knowledge and expertise needed to become a giant in just a few decades.

{"author": "Juan Sp\u00ednelli", "content": "<p><strong>Fine Fettle</strong>, Norwalk&#8217;s first <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis\">cannabis</a> dispensary, is facing a solar energy conundrum. The company is asking the city's Planning and Zoning Commission to waive a solar panel installation requirement at its 191 Main St. site, citing feasibility issues that could impact its bottom line. As <a href=\"https://www.ctinsider.com/cannabis/article/norwalk-fine-fettle-cannabis-solar-panels-19747688.php\">reported</a> by CT Insider, the dispensary, which opened in March 2024, was initially granted a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N4b-i6hZvlWTKTtkVJp7B2mnsL34WmfY/view\">special permit</a> in 2023, contingent on installing rooftop and covered parking solar panels or providing a feasibility report explaining why it couldn&#8217;t comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the Commission's September 5 meeting, Fine Fettle chief operating officer <strong>Ben Zachs</strong> submitted calculations highlighting the challenges. According to Zachs, rooftop solar panels are not financially viable for the site, as shading from a nearby tree significantly limits potential energy output. \"This is not a philosophical issue, it's a feasibility issue of having a small roof with a tree blocking it and not wanting to spend money on something that's going to take longer than our rent to pay back,\" Zachs explained during the meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Solar Feasibility And Financial Hurdles</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fine Fettle&#8217;s request stems from concerns that the investment required for solar installation won&#8217;t provide sufficient financial returns within the 10-year lease term for the property. The company&#8217;s estimates, based on assessments from solar firms, suggest that rooftop solar would only generate about 6,500 kWh annually\u2014far below the National Renewable Energy Laboratory&#8217;s (NREL) projections of over 49,000 kWh. The discrepancy is largely attributed to shading from the tree, which Fine Fettle does not own and cannot remove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CTEC Solar</strong>, the Bloomfield-based company that provided Fine Fettle's estimate, also advised against moving forward with the project. \"We are not advising moving forward with this project as Fine Fettle's usage is much greater (than 6,500 kWh), and the financial benefits do not align,\" said CTEC owner and president <strong>Mickey Toro</strong> in a letter included in the commission's memo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fine Fettle's internal calculations, using CTEC&#8217;s figures, estimate a return on investment (ROI) of only 2.4%, with costs balanced out over a span of 40 years\u2014well beyond the company's current lease term. Another solar company, <strong>Telyon</strong>, declined the project entirely, citing a similarly low ROI of 2.9%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Parking Lot Dilemma</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the rooftop challenges, the commission suggested Fine Fettle explore solar panel installation in the adjacent parking lot, which is owned by the same lessor. However, Zachs expressed concerns about losing valuable parking spaces. \"We generally have about nine to 11 of our 74 open hours a week where we are using all of the parking spots, and there are people circling around,\" he said, emphasizing the operational impact of reducing parking capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commission previously approved a landscaping feature that could replace two parking spaces, but Zachs requested that the condition be waived, citing the current parking demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Path Forward</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While Fine Fettle does not oppose solar energy\u2014the company uses solar power at its other locations in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/connecticut-cannabis\">Connecticut</a>\u2014it insists that the Main St. site presents unique challenges that make solar installation financially and operationally impractical. Despite this, the commission&#8217;s memo indicated that the company's calculations did not fully meet the feasibility condition, which requires a comprehensive ROI summary including cost, production and payoff details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cover image made with AI</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T20:11:38Z", "headline": "Norwalk, CT's First Cannabis Dispensary Faces Solar Panel Dilemma: Tree Shade And Low ROI Hinder Compliance", "id": 40886588, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/3-1.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/3-1.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/3-1.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Fine Fettle requests a waiver of Norwalk&#39;s solar panel requirement, citing feasibility and financial concerns at its Main St. cannabis dispensary location.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T20:11:38Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40886588/norwalk-cts-first-cannabis-dispensary-faces-solar-panel-dilemma-tree-shade-and-low-roi-hinder-co"}

In 2006, she and her partner, Frank, began their journey in Colorado as caregivers. As the industry evolved, Shaw shifted into consulting, helping cultivators transition from small-scale, homegrown setups to fully operational commercial grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 when she and her team were selected to manage one of the few DEA-sanctioned cannabis grows. \"We had to treat cannabis like it was fentanyl,\" Shaw explained, referring to the strict Schedule I drug guidelines they had to follow. This high-level compliance experience gave her invaluable knowledge about federal cannabis cultivation protocols, setting Brighterside Farms apart in a rapidly changing industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133244/IPM-Clones-edit-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-550233\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133244/IPM-Clones-edit-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133244/IPM-Clones-edit-225x300.jpg 225w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133244/IPM-Clones-edit.jpg 810w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why New Jersey?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Shaw and her team foresaw the potential of New Jersey's cannabis market. \"<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/new-jersey-cannabis\">New Jersey</a> is my home,\" Shaw explained, having grown up in Philadelphia and South Jersey. But more than nostalgia drove this move. With only a few large cultivators operating in the state, there was\u2014and still is\u2014a gap for high-quality, artisanal cannabis. Shaw saw the perfect opportunity to fill it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sustainability Meets Craftsmanship</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brighterside Farms uses a living soil system, which is both <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/09/23003633/watch-legal-ep-iii-cannabis-and-living-soil-with-juan-tambolini-of-uruguays-tambo-farms\">environmentally sustainable</a> and cost-effective. The grow beds are filled with organic, nutrient-rich soil that is reused after each harvest, reducing the farm&#8217;s operational costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Our COGs (cost of goods sold) are low,\" Shaw pointed out. Traditional grow methods, which use Rockwool and salts, discard their growing medium after each cycle, whereas Brighterside Farms refreshes their soil with dry amendments, significantly lowering waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation spans 2,500 square feet under the canopy and operates with a skeleton crew.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaw&#8217;s team includes herself, her partner Frank, a part-time helper and even her mother, who assists with packaging. Despite the small team, the company manages to outpace many larger operations, proving that expertise trumps size when it comes to efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40845389/nj-governor-signs-bill-tightening-rules-on-hemp-industry-stakeholders-protest-big-alcohol-celebr\">NJ Governor Signs Bill Tightening Rules On Hemp: Industry Stakeholders Protest, Big Alcohol Celebrates</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Brighterside's Market Segmentation&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaw has developed three distinct product lines: Heritage, Exotic and Reserve. These categories cater to a broad spectrum of cannabis consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Heritage: Focuses on nostalgic strains like Sour Diesel and New York City Diesel, strains that East Coast consumers know and love.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exotic: Features new and trending strains like Free Mac and Cream Cakes, appealing to the \"THC chasers\" in the market.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reserve: A rotating selection of limited-edition strains that keep consumers coming back for something new.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All products are hand-trimmed, packaged in glass jars and sealed for freshness. The company is currently selling its products in 19 dispensaries, with over 50 more on the waitlist. This demand speaks volumes about the quality and consistency of Brighterside's offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133109/Early-Flower-edit-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"weed cannabis marijuana new jersey\" class=\"wp-image-550229\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133109/Early-Flower-edit-1024x768.jpg 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133109/Early-Flower-edit-300x225.jpg 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133109/Early-Flower-edit-768x576.jpg 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133109/Early-Flower-edit.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Courtesy of Brighterside Farms</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Power Of Small-Batch Craft Cannabis</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While many New Jersey growers aim for large-scale, commercial operations, Brighterside Farms has chosen a different path: craft cannabis. Its commitment to quality over quantity has helped it carve out a niche in a crowded market.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Our consumers are educated,\" Shaw emphasized. \"They're looking for more than just high-THC; they want flavor, aroma and a connection to the plant.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Shaw, Brighterside's products deliver a longer-lasting, more potent high due to their higher nutritional value and the careful preservation of<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/05/38626097/why-does-tangie-smell-so-fruity-because-non-terpene-compounds-include-guava-papaya-and-passionfru\"> terpenes</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Smoking organic weed is like choosing an heirloom tomato over a mass-produced one\u2014it's just better,\" she explained. \"Our cannabis has a higher nutritional value, which leads to a more sustainable high. Customers have told us, \u2018I used to need four jars a week, but with your product, I only need one.'\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaw also emphasized the importance of terpenes: \"It's what gives cannabis its flavor and aroma, and we want to make sure that when our customers open a jar, they get that full experience.\" To preserve that quality, she noted, \"We hand-trim and seal all our jars with heat induction to lock in freshness, so when you open it, it's like opening something that was just harvested.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133345/Brighterside-Packaging-35927-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-550235\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133345/Brighterside-Packaging-35927-1024x683.jpg 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133345/Brighterside-Packaging-35927-300x200.jpg 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133345/Brighterside-Packaging-35927-768x512.jpg 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133345/Brighterside-Packaging-35927-1536x1024.jpg 1536w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/16133345/Brighterside-Packaging-35927.jpg 1620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Brighter Future&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the farm expands, it remains focused on crafting exclusive strains and participating in the next cannabis cup in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/new-jersey-cannabis\">New Jersey's market</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40346190/75-for-an-eighth-of-an-ounce-why-are-new-jersey-cannabis-prices-still-so-high\"> $75 For An Eighth Of An Ounce?

It&#8217;s more kind of the start of a process,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Six months, a year, 18 months from now, you&#8217;re going to see much lower rates, and that&#8217;ll really help to juice things, but in the near term, it&#8217;s going to have a pretty negligible impact for most people,&#8221; Ayers says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rate cut of 25 or 50 basis points doesn&#8217;t mean rates that affect consumers&#8217; wallets will drop expectedly, said <strong>Matt Schulz</strong>, <strong>LendingTree, Inc.</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TREE#NASDAQ\">TREE</a>) chief credit analyst.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40763384/federal-reserves-potential-rate-cut-pause-jpmorgans-stock-market-warning-and-more-this-week-in-econo\">Federal Reserve&#8217;s Potential Rate Cut Pause, JPMorgan&#8217;s Stock Market Warning, And More: This Week In Economics</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While lower rates are certainly a good thing for those struggling with debt, the truth is that this one rate cut isn't really going to make much of a difference for most people,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It doesn't change the fact that the best thing people can do to lower interest rates is to take matters into their own hands.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the average rate on a new credit card offer should stay at a record high of 24.92% for some time if the Fed lowers rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While they'll almost certainly fall from record highs in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Barring the Fed unexpectedly stomping on the gas pedal when it comes to lowering rates, credit card APRs are still going to be high for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A $5,000 credit card balance would take 27 months and $1,528 in interest to pay off at 24.92% if monthly payments of $250 were made. If the interest rate went down by 0.25% because of a 0.25% Fed rate cut, the interest paid over 27 months would fall by $22, resulting in savings of less than a dollar a month, Schulz noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schulz said auto loan rates will get lower, too, if the Fed reduces rates, but consumers should still shop around for financing from other places besides dealerships because their rates are typically much higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving rates have already started falling and may keep doing so, but consumers don&#8217;t need to panic, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yields aren't going to fall off a cliff immediately after the Fed cuts rates,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Mortgage lenders and credit card companies trended upward into Monday&#8217;s late-afternoon trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bank of America Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BAC#NYSE\">BAC</a>) rose 1.31% to $39.15</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rocket Companies, Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RKT#NYSE\">RKT</a>) gained 3.87% to $20.38</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Discover Financial Services </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DFS#NYSE\">DFS</a>) went up 1.98% to $133.93</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capital One Financial Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/COF#NYSE\">COF</a>) went up 1.82% to $141.50</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Now:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40879982/with-fed-rate-cuts-imminent-heres-which-crypto-sector-could-benefit-the-most-according-to-\">With Fed Rate Cuts Imminent, Here&#8217;s Which Crypto Sector Could Benefit The Most, According To Bernstein</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T20:23:34Z", "headline": "If Fed Cuts Interest Rates, Credit Card APRs 'Are Still Going To Be High' For Now, Economist Says", "id": 40886945, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/FederalReserve-InterestRates-Shutterstoc.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/FederalReserve-InterestRates-Shutterstoc.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/FederalReserve-InterestRates-Shutterstoc.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Cutting interest rates may help when it comes to savings, and CDs; And mortgage rates may drop, but not by much.", "symbols": ["BAC", "COF", "DFS", "NWFAX", "RKT", "TREE"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T20:23:35Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40886945/if-fed-cuts-interest-rates-credit-card-aprs-are-still-going-to-be-high-for-now-econ"}

Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 1.21 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>PDD Holdings Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1726518611_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for PDD Holdings has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing PDD Holdings's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing.

The study noted that only 17.8% of respondents considered themselves &#8220;out&#8221; (or open) about their drug use, showing that the majority prefer not to disclose this information in professional settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclosure is a particularly delicate matter. While 59% of researchers who have used drugs shared this information with colleagues within their institutions, only 11% disclosed it in the context of their research or grant applications. Although some believe their personal drug use enriches their work, many are concerned that it may negatively affect how their scientific objectivity is perceived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Researchers believe drug use could strengthen research questions,\" the study noted, acknowledging the value of &#8220;experiential knowledge,&#8221; meaning that the personal experiences of professionals can contribute to their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, ethical and professional concerns remain, and there is a recognized need to continue the debate and exploration of this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover image generated with AI, edited in Canva by El Planteo.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is from an external unpaid contributor.

The new episodes in questions would be made exclusively for Netflix. It is unknown if Netflix is hoping to land the rights to the current series and make the episodes live, or to launch something completely different from the current show and format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 25<sup>th</sup> season of \"Hot Ones\" is set to begin on Sept. 19 featuring soccer legend<strong> Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Netflix has shifted its strategy from acquiring third-party content to producing original programming in collaboration with partners, creating exclusive content for the platform.The streaming giant has also shifted its sports focus, going from airing sports docuseries to bidding on live sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, the company has aired several comedy live specials and also some live sports specials, including a recent <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/09/40692059/joey-chestnut-breaks-hot-dog-eating-contest-record-how-netflix-could-benefit-from-live-spor\">hot dog eating competition</a> featuring <strong>Joey Chestnut.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, Netflix will also acquire the rights to stream World Wrestling Entertainment content and will broadcast two live National Football League games on Christmas Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One potential challenge in bringing &#8220;Hot Ones&#8221; to a live format could be how the show's dynamic translates in real time.

The facilitation of these licenses is part of the government's &#8220;master plan,&#8221; aimed at establishing and growing the cannabis and hemp industry in the country. The overarching goal is to promote economic growth, reduce poverty and create jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheme proposed by President <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong> and his team is built on nine pillars. These pillars include regulatory services, sustainable seed systems, research and development, producer support, market development, business growth, and education and awareness initiatives, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Minister Ramokgopa's Insights On Regulation Progress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acting Minister in the Presidency, <strong>Maropene Ramokgopa,</strong> confirmed ongoing regulatory efforts: &#8220;The Department of Health, through the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, has concluded consultations on changes to the Schedules of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) has developed two hemp varieties and is working on seed multiplication, preparing for the 2025 planting season. A certification system for hemp has also been approved, ensuring the quality and integrity of the varieties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hemp In South Africa: Impact On Small Farmers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramokgopa also highlighted support for small businesses. For instance, in Gauteng province, 10 micro-enterprises have received aid to develop hemp and cannabis-derived products, in collaboration with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all communities have benefited equally. Current policies have made it difficult for regions like Mpondoland to compete with more sophisticated urban operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My grandfather sent us to school with money from growing dagga. Our parents even bought us cattle and clothes from growing \u2026 Everything has changed now,&#8221; shared Landiwe Msolongile, a 60-year-old farmer, in an <a href=\"https://groundup.org.za/article/mpondoland-dagga-growers-left-out-to-dry/\">interview</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Struggles Of Small-Scale Cannabis Producers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Small cannabis farmers have seen a dramatic drop in prices, with earnings plummeting from ZAR 2,000 ($113) per 20-liter bucket to just ZAR 500. This has led to a sharp decrease in income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make up for falling prices, farmers increased production, creating a surplus they struggle to sell, with some even burning their crops to manage the excess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compounding these challenges, droughts have worsened the situation. &#8220;We keep trying to plant but have no harvest. Sometimes the rain fools us and we think it has returned,&#8221; Msolongile lamented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to their woes, stronger, foreign cannabis strains have entered the market, reducing demand for indigenous varieties. Large companies operating in legal gray areas have also penetrated the South African market, selling more potent, cheaper cannabis in unregulated dispensaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the government pledged to support local farmers, the only legal avenue to participate in the industry remains costly and complicated. Despite the government's initiatives, these projects have yet to benefit regions like Mpondoland.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is from an external unpaid contributor.

They argue that current interest rates are overly restrictive given the state of inflation and the labor market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Wall Street analysts and big banks (i.e., Goldman Sachs and Bank of America) are cautious. They forecast a more modest 25-basis-point cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank of America did, however, note that a &#8220;weak retail sales report&#8221; on Tuesday could tip the scales toward more aggressive easing. &#8220;A very weak retail sales report&#8221; would likely signal weakening consumer spending, potentially prompting the Fed to initiate a larger rate cut to support economic activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle commented that a larger cut would be &#8220;somewhat out of keeping with usual Fed practice.&#8221; He highlighted that such significant cuts are typically reserved for clear economic crises or notable spikes in unemployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veteran Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni also weighed in on the debate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fifty is the usual amount kicking off an easing cycle, but the economic circumstances are different this time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There's no recession clearly barreling toward us.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Yardeni, if the Fed opts for a larger cut, stock prices could continue to soar, potentially inflating a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;25bps would be enough for now pending the next batch of data releases\u2014which we expect once again will confirm the economy's resilience,&#8221; he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40883274/senator-warren-urges-fed-to-slash-rates-by-0-75-veteran-investor-warns-even-0-5-cut\">Elizabeth Warren Urges Fed To Slash Rates By 0.75%; Veteran Investor Warns Even 0.5% Cut Could &#8216;Reduce Trump&#8217;s Chances Of Winning&#8217;</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T20:46:56Z", "headline": "Long-Dated Treasury Bond ETF Hits 14-Month Highs Ahead Of Imminent Fed Rate Cut", "id": 40887448, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/treasury-bond-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/treasury-bond-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/treasury-bond-shutter.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF surged 0.8% on Monday, climbing above $101 per share to its highest level since July 2023.", "symbols": ["TLT"], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T20:46:57Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40887448/long-dated-treasury-bond-etf-hits-14-month-highs-ahead-of-imminent-fed-rate-cut"}

The streaming giant will air its first NFL games in the 2024 season with two highly anticipated Christmas day matchups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix will stream the Kansas City Chiefs at Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 p.m. ET and the Baltimore Ravens at Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. ET on Christmas Day.

Governor Kemp raised the legal age in response to concerns about hemp products, particularly edibles, being marketed to resemble popular children&#8217;s snacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The law aims to address this issue directly by mandating that no product should be \"attractive to children\" or mimic any existing snack brand. To further safeguard minors, all cannabis products must now be \"tamper-evident and child-resistant,\" ensuring extra layers of protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hemp Stores Face New Location Rules</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The law goes beyond product marketing, imposing new zoning restrictions on hemp stores across the state. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any retailer selling cannabis products must now be located at least 500 feet from schools\u2014whether public or private\u2014where elementary or secondary education is provided. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stores Will Pull Certain Edibles From Shelves</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a move that may disrupt some hemp retailers, Bill 494 bans the sale of CBD or cannabis-infused food products such as chocolates and alcoholic beverages. However, not all edibles are off-limits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gummies, a popular form of CBD, will remain legal under the new law, as do oils that aren&#8217;t mixed into any type of food or drink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For store owners, this means acting quickly to remove prohibited products from shelves. The law requires immediate compliance for any food-based CBD product, meaning that those who continue to sell banned items may face significant penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36246587/dea-vs-georgia-tensions-rise-over-medical-cannabis-access-as-state-regulators-consider-legal-act\">DEA vs. Georgia: Tensions Rise Over Medical Cannabis Access As State Regulators Consider Legal Action</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image created with AI.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-16T21:30:29Z", "headline": "Georgia Tightens Hemp Laws: New Restrictions On Age Limits, Edibles, Store Locations To Take Effect Oct. 1", "id": 40888436, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/DALLE-2024-09-16-18-10.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/DALLE-2024-09-16-18-10.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/16/DALLE-2024-09-16-18-10.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Georgia&#39;s new hemp law takes effect on October 1, banning sales to under-21s and removing food-based CBD products.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-16T21:30:30Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40888436/georgia-tightens-hemp-laws-new-restrictions-on-age-limits-edibles-store-locations-to-take-effect"}

This is despite both candidates holding undergraduate degrees in economics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Trump&#8217;s proposed tariffs, including a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods, are viewed as a significant economic threat by Furman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tariffs would cover $4 trillion of imports, a substantial increase from President <strong>Joe Biden&#8217;s</strong> tariffs which covered $18 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, Harris has shown a more restrained approach towards tariffs and has proposed expanding the Child Tax Credit and extending the expiring tax cuts for those earning below $400,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s proposed budget measures could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit, while Harris&#8217;s proposals could lead to a $1.5 trillion deficit increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Trump often listened to sensible advisers and walked away from some terrible economic policies as president,&#8221; wrote Furman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some of his defenders believe he will do so again\u2014and I hope they're right.

Ahead of the all-important meeting, Nobel laureate <strong>Paul Krugman </strong>said on Monday the fed funds rates are &#8220;too high.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Turns Benign: </strong>The Fed targets inflation of around 2% over the longer run, with its favorite inflation gauge being the annual rate of the price index for personal consumption expenditure. The latest available data show that the annual rate of headline and core consumer price inflation was 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively, in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the personal consumption expenditure as an inflation measure shows the annual headline and core rate at 2.5% and 2.6%, respectively, in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krugman said inflation is basically in line with the target if the lagging shelter measures are accounted for. Pointing to the job openings data, he said, &#8220;The labor market is cooler than it was before the pandemic.&#8221; Job openings fell to 8.83 million in July, the lowest since 2021, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, the labor market is cooler than it was before the pandemic 2/ <a href=\"https://t.co/nkxhKFjpYd\">pic.twitter.com/nkxhKFjpYd</a></p>&mdash; Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1835652859934675165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-inflation-stocks\">Best Inflation Stocks</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rates Elevated:</strong> Juxtaposing that with the Fed funds rate, Krugman noted that even a 50-point cut would leave the Fed funds rate 300 basis points above pre-pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"730\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17015844/image-1-33.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-550990\" style=\"width:920px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17015844/image-1-33.png 730w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17015844/image-1-33-300x224.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How can this be justified?&#8221; he asked. While self-answering the question, the economist said the economy doesn&#8217;t seem to be in a recession yet. The Fed is apparently waiting to adjust the taps until it turns ice-cold, he said, adding that &#8220;maybe it&#8217;s PTSD from the unexpected inflation of 2021-22, but it&#8217;s still a big mistake.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Also bear in mind that the risks are asymmetric: we&#8217;re probably back in the world where excessively loose monetary policy will only gradually affect inflation, while a labor market downturn could happen very fast,&#8221; Krugman said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realistically, there is hope for a 50 basis-point cut, the economist said. He, however, said the argument for incrementalism is very weak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, economists on the other end of the spectrum such as <strong>Peter Schiff</strong> think <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40890618/peter-schiff-says-unlikely-that-fed-rate-cuts-will-lower-borrowing-costs-predicts-rising-mortgage-ra\">a rate cut now would be a huge mistake, </a>as it would potentially weaken the dollar and fan inflationary pressure, with the vicious cycle continuing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iShares TIPS Bond ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TIP#NYSE\">TIP</a>), an ETF tracking the investment results of an index composed of inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds, ended Monday's session up 0.34% at $110.82, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/lxquj26b2sag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Pro data</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Next:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40872851/s-p-500-implied-volatility-suggests-100-point-swing-as-fed-decision-looms-experts-say-market-may\"><strong>S&amp;P 500 Implied Volatility Suggests 100-Point Swing As Fed Decision Looms: Experts Say Market May Collapse After Rate Cuts</strong></a></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by TANYA LARA on Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-17T06:35:21Z", "headline": "Ahead Of FOMC Meeting Paul Krugman Says Fed Rates Will Be Elevated Even With 50 Bps Cut: 'Argument For Incrementalism Is Very Weak'", "id": 40891378, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/Paul-Krugman.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/Paul-Krugman.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/Paul-Krugman.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Recent weak growth data and benign inflation data has sealed the fate of the Fed rate cut  but economists hold a mixed view on the policy outcome.", "symbols": ["TIP"], "updated_at": "2024-09-17T06:35:22Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40891378/ahead-of-fomc-meeting-paul-krugman-says-fed-rates-will-be-elevated-even-with-50-bps"}

Williams proposes a ranking system, where employees assess their necessity in the meeting&nbsp;on a scale of one&nbsp;to five. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an employee frequently finds themselves ranking as a four or five, they are likely competent at their job. This assessment of scale one to five ranges from simple observers as the lowest rank and people who call the meetings as the highest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, Williams advises employees to objectively evaluate their work results, comparing them to peers, especially those outside their company. This can provide a more accurate assessment of their performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Subscribe to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://bztechtrends.beehiiv.com/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter</em></a><em>&nbsp;to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams concludes by reminding employees that they are often their own harshest critics, and that self-doubt is a common occurrence, even among top executives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When that voice in your head screams, &#8216;They&#8217;re just being nice to me,&#8217; think that through.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p><strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>) has banned <strong>RT</strong>, <strong>Rossiya Segodnya</strong>, and other Russian state media from its platforms. The ban, announced on Monday, marks an escalation in Meta&#8217;s efforts to combat foreign interference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The decision follows accusations that these outlets employed deceptive tactics for covert influence operations online, reported Reuters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This action represents a significant escalation in Meta&#8217;s efforts against Russian state media, which previously included blocking ads and limiting post reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta stated, &#8220;After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enforcement will roll out over the coming days across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ban follows recent U.S. money laundering charges against two RT employees for allegedly attempting to influence the 2024 election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State <strong>Antony Blinken</strong> recently urged countries to treat RT&#8217;s activities like covert intelligence operations.

Earlier this year, Meta took down numerous Facebook accounts linked to covert influence campaigns from countries including China, Iran, Russia, and Israel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These campaigns <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39077408/meta-cracks-down-on-ai-generated-fake-news-campaigns-from-four-countries-including-china-and-russia\">reportedly used artificial intelligence</a> tools to spread disinformation, as highlighted in Meta&#8217;s quarterly threat report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Meta has faced <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/08/40575260/mark-zuckerberg-reveals-biden-administration-pressured-meta-platforms-to-censor-certain-covid-19-\">pressure from various governments</a> to regulate content on its platforms.

He will remain with the company until November 30 to assist with the leadership transition, concluding his 11-year tenure at Starbucks, Business Insider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-north-america-ceo-retires-michael-conway-without-replacement-2024-9?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=business-sf&amp;utm_medium=social\">reported</a> on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before his North American CEO role, Conway served as group president of international and channel development and president of Starbucks Canada. His appointment was part of a reorganization effort by former CEO <strong>Laxman Narasimhan</strong>, Bloomberg noted in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than appointing a new CEO for North America, Starbucks announced that <strong>Sara Trilling</strong>, the company&#8217;s North American president, will oversee retail operations across the region. Trilling has been with Starbucks for 22 years and previously managed 3,500 stores as senior vice president of its north division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40874566/apple-shares-slide-in-monday-premarket-whats-souring-sentiment?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple Shares Slide In Monday Premarket: What&#8217;s Souring Sentiment?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company aims to enhance decision-making efficiency by streamlining its leadership structure, The Wall Street Journal reported. Conway&#8217;s departure follows other significant leadership changes, including the recent appointment of <strong>Brian Niccol</strong>, former CEO of Chipotle, as Starbucks&#8217; new top executive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operational challenges have affected Starbucks&#8217; North American stores, with complex drink orders, rising prices, and varying foot traffic impacting staff and profitability. Niccol plans to revamp operations and focus on customer experience, he stated last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This leadership change comes amid a series of strategic shifts at Starbucks. In March, the company announced a new geographic leadership structure to support global functions, appointing Conway as North America CEO <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37824686/starbucks-stirs-up-leadership-for-worldwide-expansion-details\">to spearhead this initiative</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, the appointment of <strong>Brian Niccol</strong> as the new CEO boosted Starbucks&#8217; valuation by over $15 billion in just one day. Niccol, known for his successful tenure at Chipotle, aims to steer Starbucks through its current challenges <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40396716/starbucks-new-ceo-brian-niccol-boosts-company-valuation-by-over-15b-in-one-day-whats-his-net-worth\">and enhance customer experience</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his second day as CEO, Niccol outlined his vision to reconnect Starbucks with its community coffeehouse roots. He emphasized the need for comfortable seating and a clear distinction between \"to-go\" and \"for-here\" services <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40809142/brian-niccol-outlines-vision-to-reconnect-starbucks-with-community-coffeehouse-roots-on-his-2nd-day\">to improve the in-store experience</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40828224/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-hed-fire-in-a-second-anyone-caught-trading-bitcoin-when-it-w?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Said He&#8217;d &#8216;Fire In A Second&#8217; Anyone Caught Trading Bitcoin When It Was At $4,000. 7 Years Later, The Investment Bank Holds Positions In Spot ETFs Tracking The Apex Crypto</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image by \u015eahin Sezer Din\u00e7er from Pixabay.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Pooja-Rajkumari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pooja Rajkumari</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-17T07:33:04Z", "headline": "Starbucks North America CEO Michael Conway Quits After Just 6 Months In The Position", "id": 40892040, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/starbucks-5460799-1920.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/starbucks-5460799-1920.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/starbucks-5460799-1920.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Before his North American CEO role, Conway served as group president of international and channel development and president of Starbucks Canada.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>In a significant development, the U.S. State Department has greenlit a potential military sale to Taiwan valued at approximately $228 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The sale encompasses the return, repair, and reshipment of spare parts from U.S. Government stock. The State Department noted that Taiwan&#8217;s military could seamlessly integrate this equipment into its armed forces, Reuters reported on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan&#8217;s Ministry of National Defense expressed appreciation for the arms package, anticipating it to &#8220;become effective&#8221; within a month.

{"author": "Anan Ashraf", "content": "<p>Drivers tend to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40121851/teslas-autopilot-system-failed-in-deadly-2022-crash-involving-motorcyclist-alleges-lawsuit\">pay less attention to the road </a>and multitask when using partial automation to drive despite automakers mandating constant supervision, as per new research. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: According to new research from the\u00a0Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), drivers are more likely to multitask when using partial automation systems. Multitasking involves checking their phones, eating a sandwich, or doing other visual-manual activities, the study said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IIHS conducted the study with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AgeLab and tested driver attentiveness while using <strong>Volvo Car's</strong> (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VLVCY#OTC\">VLVCY</a>) Pilot Assist partial automation system and <strong>Tesla Inc.'s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) Autopilot system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla autopilot users mastered the timing of the system&#8217;s attention reminder feature and made minor movements routinely to keep the warnings at bay while also engaging in distracting behaviors, the study found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"In both these studies, drivers adapted their behavior to engage in distracting activities,\" IIHS President <strong>David Harkey</strong> said. \"This demonstrates why partial automation systems need more&nbsp;robust safeguards&nbsp;to prevent misuse.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither of the two partial automation systems tested makes the vehicle entirely autonomous. Both require the driver to pay active attention to the road to take over when required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> While the deployment of autonomous driving technology continues to be plagued with technical, monetary, and regulatory challenges, several automakers offer driver assistance features that partly automate driving but require active supervision from the driver. Most even require the driver to have their hands on the steering wheels at all times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, Tesla recalled over <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/12/36212289/tesla-issues-massive-recall-of-over-2m-vehicles-over-autosteer-concerns\">2 million vehicles</a> equipped with all versions of Autosteer, a part of autopilot, after deeming the feature's controls to be insufficient to prevent misuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla subsequently released a software update to fix the issue. In April, however, the U.S. auto safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/04/38454591/breaking-nhtsa-starts-probe-into-teslas-software-fix-for-2m-vehicles-recalled-in-december\">commenced a probe</a> to determine whether the software update is sufficient to address the concerns of shifting driver attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>following this link</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40891218/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-in-canada-expected-in-late-october\">Tesla Cybertruck Deliveries In Canada Expected In Late October</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Unsplash</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-17T09:31:14Z", "headline": "Drivers Tend To Multitask And Pay Less Attention To The Road While Using Tesla's Autopilot And Volvo's Pilot Assist, Study Finds", "id": 40892924, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/Automated-Driving.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/Automated-Driving.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/17/Automated-Driving.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Drivers tend to pay less attention to the road when using partial automation to drive, as per new research, despite automakers mandating constant supervision.", "symbols": ["TSLA", "VLVCY"], "updated_at": "2024-09-17T09:31:14Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40892924/drivers-tend-to-multitask-and-pay-less-attention-to-the-road-while-using-teslas-autopilot-and-volvos"}
