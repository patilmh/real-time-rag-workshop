Symbotic went public in mid-2022 via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle and has been backed by <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>&#8216;s <strong>SoftBank Group Corp</strong>.

According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>, the stock closed at $19.20 on Monday. The company&#8217;s value has now decreased to under $10 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decline is attributed to construction delays and increased implementation costs, which have squeezed profit margins.

Lawmakers are required to disclose their financial assets within 45 days of any transaction, with the value of trades typically mentioned in a range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pelosi&#8217;s \u00a020 Broadcom call options were purchased on June 24, with a strike price of $800 and an expiration date of June 20, 2025. The purchase was made after the company reported its second-quarter results on June 12 and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. The stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The congresswoman&#8217;s call options now have a strike price of $80, giving effect to the split. One option contract represents 100 numbers of underlying shares.  A call option gives&nbsp;the owner the right,&nbsp;but not the obligation, to buy an&nbsp;underlying security at a specific price within a specified time, which is the expiration date.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>In a recent development, <strong>Boeing Co.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BA#NYSE\">BA</a>) saw a minor pre-market dip on Tuesday. The decline comes in the wake of a potential strike by 32,000 of the company&#8217;s workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The contract between Boeing and the International Association of Machinists is on the brink of expiration on Sep. 12. In the absence of a new agreement, the workers who assemble its aircraft in Washington state are gearing up for the company&#8217;s first strike in 16 years. Union local head Jon Holden expressed that the chances for a deal seem slim at the moment, CNN<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/business/boeing-strike-threat/index.html\"> reported</a> on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holden pointed out that the primary disagreements include wages, health care, retirement, and time off. This potential strike adds to a series of high-profile problems for Boeing, which has been dealing with fatal crashes due to design flaws, allegations of prioritizing profits over quality and safety, a decrease in aircraft sales, and rising debt levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite both parties expressing a wish to avoid a strike, the resentment of union members over recent contract concessions and difficulties at the company could make reaching an agreement difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boeing&#8217;s shares were trading at $169 at the time of writing, 2.73% down from Monday&#8217;s closing price of $173.74, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40666864/rudy-giulianis-legal-troubles-deepen-former-georgia-election-workers-seek-to-seize-assets?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s Legal Troubles Deepen: Former Georgia Election Workers Seek To Seize Assets</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boeing issued a statement affirming their commitment to bargaining in good faith and focusing on the issues important to their employees and their families. However, Holden insisted that any deal that can gain the support of the workers needs to recapture some of the concessions the union surrendered in two previous agreements since 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The potential strike comes at a time when Boeing is already grappling with a safety crisis. Newly appointed CEO <strong>Kelly Ortberg</strong>, who replaced <strong>Dave Calhoun,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40282460/boeings-new-ceo-kelly-ortberg-shifts-base-to-seattle-amid-airplane-makers-safety-crisis\">recently relocated to Seattle</a> to address these issues. The move followed criticism that the company had lost touch with its manufacturing roots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the company&#8217;s woes, a Boeing 737 aircraft recently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40585703/boeing-737-aircraft-experiences-engine-trouble-during-alaska-airlines-flight-forced-to-turn-around\">experienced engine trouble</a> during an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing it to turn around.

This decision prompted Kennedy to file a lawsuit against North Carolina to have his name removed from the 2024 presidential ballot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, North Carolina officials have denied Kennedy&#8217;s request, citing practical and financial constraints.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>Some of the world&#8217;s most prominent tech leaders like <strong>Bill Gates</strong>, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, and the leader of the AI revolution, <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, have expressed differing opinions about <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/11/35927838/bill-gates-thinks-technology-ai-could-usher-in-a-three-day-work-week\">AI&#8217;s impact on jobs</a>. However, it might not be all that distressing, and in some cases, actually boosts the productivity of employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Alorica, a customer-service company based in Irvine, California, has implemented an AI translation tool that allows representatives to communicate in 200 languages and 75 dialects, Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-jobs-artificial-intelligence-hiring-employers-unemployment-e57eb040009d77ddcce1574d1c1915fc?taid=66d6c2131a022c00015e5f4d&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">reported</a> on Monday. Despite fears that AI might lead to job cuts, Alorica is still hiring aggressively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alorica&#8217;s representatives in San Antonio were seen using the AI tool to handle customer calls efficiently. The tool enables a representative who speaks only Spanish to assist a Cantonese-speaking customer, eliminating the need to hire additional staff for language-specific roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alorica&#8217;s experience suggests that AI may not be the job eliminator many fear. Instead, it could enhance productivity and create new job opportunities. The White House Council of Economic Advisers recently found &#8220;little evidence that AI will negatively impact overall employment,&#8221; noting that technology often boosts productivity and economic growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alorica&#8217;s co-CEO, <strong>Mike Clifton</strong>, highlighted the efficiency gains, stating that AI tools have significantly reduced call handling times.

The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales. Alongside online ads, Google services houses sales stemming from Google's subscription services (YouTube TV, YouTube Music among others), platforms (sales and in-app purchases on Play Store), and devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products such as Chromecast). Google's cloud computing platform, or GCP, accounts for roughly 10% of Alphabet's revenue with the firm's investments in up-and-coming technologies such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health (Verily), and internet access (Google Fiber) making up the rest.</p>\n<h3>Alphabet: Delving into Financials</h3>\n<p><strong>Market Capitalization Analysis:</strong> With an elevated market capitalization, the company stands out above industry averages, showcasing substantial size and market acknowledgment.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Revenue Trend:</strong> Examining Alphabet's financials over 3 months reveals a positive narrative. The company achieved a noteworthy revenue growth rate of <strong>13.59%</strong> as of 30 June, 2024, showcasing a substantial increase in top-line earnings. As compared to its peers, the company achieved a growth rate higher than the average among peers in Communication Services sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Margin:</strong> Alphabet's net margin excels beyond industry benchmarks, reaching <strong>27.87%</strong>. This signifies efficient cost management and strong financial health.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Alphabet's ROE excels beyond industry benchmarks, reaching <strong>7.96%</strong>. This signifies robust financial management and efficient use of shareholder equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Alphabet's financial strength is reflected in its exceptional ROA, which exceeds industry averages. With a remarkable ROA of <strong>5.75%,</strong> the company showcases efficient use of assets and strong financial health.</p>\n<p><strong>Debt Management:</strong> Alphabet's debt-to-equity ratio is below industry norms, indicating a sound financial structure with a ratio of <strong>0.09</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The Significance of Analyst Ratings Explained</h2>\n<p>Benzinga tracks 150 analyst firms and reports on their stock expectations. Analysts typically arrive at their conclusions by predicting how much money a company will make in the future, usually the upcoming five years, and how risky or predictable that company's revenue streams are.</p>\n<p>Analysts attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish their ratings on stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter or whenever the company has a major update.</p>\n<p>Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T12:00:37Z", "headline": "Cracking The Code: Understanding Analyst Reviews For Alphabet", "id": 40684625, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/analyst_ratings_image_0.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["GOOGL"], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T12:00:38Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/analyst-ratings/24/09/40684625/cracking-the-code-understanding-analyst-reviews-for-alphabet"}

Ahead of the crucial monthly jobs report, due on Friday, the risk-off mood is taking hold. The number has ramifications for the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rate decision due on Sept. 18. The futures market is currently pricing in a 100% probability of a rate cut, with the probability of a 25 basis-point reduction at 67% and a 50-basis-point cut at 33%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When risk sentiment wanes, risky bets such as growth stocks typically take a big hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&#8217;s weakness may also have to do with geopolitical tensions that are weighing down on the chip sector. Nvidia&#8217;s chip supplier <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSM#NYSE\">TSM</a>) fell 1.96% in premarket trading on Tuesday after a Nikkei report <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-s-chip-capabilities-just-3-years-behind-TSMC-teardown-shows\">said </a>China-made chips are now only three years behind the former&#8217;s technology, citing findings by teardown experts. The report said the U.S. efforts to obstruct exports of high-performance chips may not be effective as the domestic industry in China is gearing up to take on the challenge with innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, reports suggest China has warned of retaliation if Japan curbed exports of chipmaking equipment to the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. Japan has one of the biggest semiconductor equipment companies in Tokyo Electron and the U.S. has been pressuring  Japan against selling advanced chipmaking tools to China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">In premarket trading</a> on Tuesday, Nvidia 2.06% to $116.91.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>In a recent development, China has declared its intention to conduct an anti-dumping probe into canola imports from Canada. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>This decision comes in the wake of<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/large-cap/24/08/40558213/trudeau-announces-canadas-100-ev-tariff-on-china-for-not-playing-by-the-same-rules-ev-stocks-drop-\"> Canada&#8217;s move to impose tariffs </a>on Chinese electric vehicles, leading to a significant rise in domestic rapeseed oil futures prices, Reuters reported on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to canola, China will also scrutinize certain Canadian chemical products for dumping. Over half of Canada&#8217;s canola production is exported to China, the world&#8217;s largest oilseed importer. Canola, also known as rapeseed, is used in cooking oil and a variety of products, including renewable fuels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada, following in the footsteps of the United States and the European Union, announced a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicle imports and a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminium from China last week. China&#8217;s commerce ministry has expressed strong opposition to these &#8220;discriminatory unilateral restrictive measures.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following China&#8217;s announcement, the country&#8217;s rapeseed meal futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange rose by 6%, reaching its highest point since Aug. 6. On the other hand, the ICE canola contract for November delivery fell by 7% to $569.7 per metric ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40645108/amid-tesla-waymo-and-byd-battle-for-robotaxi-supermacy-employment-worries-rise-in-china-experts-?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amid Tesla, Waymo And BYD Battle For Robotaxi Supermacy, Employment Worries Rise In China \u2014 Experts Say Jobs Won&#8217;t Vanish In &#8216;One Go&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada&#8217;s canola exports to China, which amounted to $3.47 billion in 2023, are suspected of dumping due to a 170% year-on-year increase in volume and a continuous decline in prices.

{"author": "Shanthi Rexaline", "content": "<p>Even as several nationwide polls gave <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40672140/trump-vs-harris-new-poll-shows-vice-president-preserves-pre-dnc-lead-but-needs-to-address-3-key-issu\">Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> a narrow lead</a> over her Republican rival <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, a veteran pollster sprang a surprise by dropping his latest forecast, called Silver Bulletin forecast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The forecast issued on Sept. 1 showed Trump ahead of Harris, a chart shared on his substack <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-no-normal-in-this-election\">post</a> published on Tuesday showed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nate clarified that the numbers do not refer to the percentage of support for each but the probability of each winning the electoral college. Trump has a 55% probability of winning the all-important electoral college, while Harris&#8217; probability of winning it is 45%, he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Rather than a landslide, that implies an extremely uncertain and probably ultimately very close race \u2014 well in the range of what\u00a0we'd consider a &#8216;toss-up,'&#8221; Silver said. The chance of Harris or Trump winning the popular vote by 10 points or more, which he called a landslide, is only about 5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40669403/scaramucci-trump-wins-billionaires-support-despite-coming-off-as-raging-lunatic-harris-backs-a-ridic\">Scaramucci: Trump Wins Billionaires&#8217; Support Despite Coming Off As &#8216;Raging Lunatic,&#8217; Harris Backs A &#8216;Ridiculously Stupid Idea&#8217;</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Polling Averages Vs. Silver Forecast: </strong>Harris&#8217; odds have declined slightly over the past two weeks as she went from a 55-45% favorite to a 45-55% underdog, Silver said but added that &#8220;it&#8217;s not a huge change.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Probability calculations can be highly sensitive just to either side of the 50/50 mark,&#8221; the pollster, who founded polling analytics website FiveThirtyEight but is no longer associated with it now, said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harris&#8217; Pushback: </strong>The not-so-appreciable convention bump Harris received after the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40541970/tv-audience-for-kamala-harris-dnc-speech-surpasses-donald-trumps-rnc-address-by-22\">Aug. 19-22 Democratic National Convention </a>may have to do with some of the setbacks, Silver said. The vice president&#8217;s polling average lead went from 2.3 points before the convention to only 3.5 points after the convention, while Silver&#8217;s forecast model had factored in a 2-point bounce, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By the model's logic, she's gone from a lead of 2.3 points to a&nbsp;convention-bounce adjusted lead&nbsp;of 1.5 points. That's not a game-changing difference, but it's enough to show up in the bottom line,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, Silver said he expected the then-independent candidate <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr.&#8217;s</strong> suspension of his campaign and endorsement of Trump, to hurt Harris by 0.5 points or less. However, it is plausible that the impact may have been larger, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Harris&#8217; poor polling in Pennsylvania is disproportionately important, given it is a key swing state, the pollster said.  &#8220;As a result, the Electoral College forecast has swung more than the popular vote forecast,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Harris could be a favorite to win the popular vote &#8220;but&nbsp;perhaps a slight underdog to win the White House&nbsp;because of the GOP advantage in the Electoral College,&#8221; Silver said. He called the Harris-Trump debate on Sept. 10 as a key disruptive event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Did You Know?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Congress Is Making Huge Investments.&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</em></strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image Via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T12:46:34Z", "headline": "Trump Vs.

This shift in the currency pair&rsquo;s dynamics is primarily attributed to the latest Core PCE inflation data released last Friday, which moderated market expectations regarding the pace of future interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market is now in a consolidation phase as it awaits vital US employment data for August, set to be released this Friday. This upcoming report is critical as it could influence the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s decisions in the near term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August, the manufacturing sector in Australia continued to face challenges, with high loan servicing costs and subdued demand from both businesses and consumers acting as significant headwinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors also look forward to further insights from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michelle Bullock. Recently, she indicated that it is premature to consider a relaxation of monetary policy due to persistently high inflation despite some signs of cooling. The minutes from the latest RBA meeting have echoed this sentiment, suggesting that the central bank may maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance for an extended period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>AUD/USD Technical Analysis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/audusdh4_16.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/audusdh4_16.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AUD/USD is navigating the first wave of decline towards the level of 0.6743. There is an expectation that this target will be reached soon, followed by a corrective move to 0.6783 (testing from below). This would delineate the upper bounds of a consolidation range. Should the pair break downward from this range, a further decline to 0.6690 is anticipated. A breakout below this level could signal the start of a new downward trend towards 0.6640, potentially extending to 0.6555.

Potential outcomes range from punitive measures to a possible break-up of Google's crown jewels, Chrome and Android. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can Google Escape The DOJ&#8217;s Crosshairs?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One scenario that could play out is that Google may be forced to open up its search distribution channels \u2014 Apple, third-party browsers, Android, and Chrome \u2014 to rival search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would mean that Google would continue to pay traffic acquisition costs to partners but would have to allow competitors a foothold in its backyard, Chrome and Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does this mean for Google's bottom line? Anmuth says <strong>Google could see up to a 10% hit on its earnings per share (EPS)</strong> due to these changes, with a worst-case scenario reaching a 20% decline. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&#8217;s ability to appeal the decision could drag on for years, giving the company time to pivot its focus to other growth engines, he adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/health-care/24/08/40657322/google-stock-an-ai-play-for-health-care-the-doctor-will-hear-you-now-and-diagnose-your-cough\">Google Stock An AI Play For Health Care? The Doctor Will Hear You Now And Diagnose Your Cough</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the possibility of Google being forced to break out Chrome or Android is on the table, Anmuth sees it as unlikely. He argues that opening up these platforms to more user choice would likely achieve the DOJ's goals without the drastic step of breaking up the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there's the risk that such a move could degrade service quality, hurting consumers rather than helping them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Battle for the Future of Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s ultimate aim is to limit Google&#8217;s reach and boost competition, but Anmuth warns of privacy concerns if Google is forced to share patents or data with competitors. &#8220;The government&#8217;s goal would be to limit Google's reach,&#8221; he says, but at what cost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road ahead is uncertain for Google, but one thing is clear: the company is at a crossroads. With the DOJ trial threatening to shake up Google&#8217;s core business, Anmuth emphasizes the potential Google has in other areas \u2014 Generative AI and Cloud.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Anmuth aptly notes, \"The range of potential negative outcomes remains wide,\" but Google&#8217;s next moves could redefine its future in a rapidly changing tech landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/24/08/40652895/exclusive-beyond-the-magnificent-seven-direxions-egilinsky-reveals-top-sector-picks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EXCLUSIVE: Beyond The Magnificent Seven \u2014 Direxion&#8217;s Egilinsky Reveals Top Sector Picks</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T12:56:26Z", "headline": "Google, DOJ Trial Drama To Hit Earnings By Up To 10%, Says JPMorgan: 'Status Quo Is No Longer Possible'", "id": 40686596, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Google-Chrome-Photo-by-rafapress-on-Shut.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Google-Chrome-Photo-by-rafapress-on-Shut.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Google-Chrome-Photo-by-rafapress-on-Shut.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Google, the most-used search engine in the world, will &#34;experience a negative financial impact from potential remedies or outcomes.&#34;", "symbols": ["GOOG", "GOOGL"], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T12:56:27Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40686596/google-doj-trial-drama-to-hit-earnings-by-up-to-10-says-jpmorgan-status-quo-is-no-l"}

{"author": "The Bamboo Works", "content": "<h4><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SenseTime is progressing in its shift to generative AI, which made up 60% of revenue in the first half of this year, even as it faces challenges from price wars and GPU restrictions</li>\r\n\t<li>Despite the company&rsquo;s pivot away from more sensitive vision AI technologies, it continued to lose money in the first half, though its loss narrowed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>By Hugh Chen</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The release of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked a global revolution in artificial intelligence (AI). Overnight, the term &ldquo;AI&rdquo; became synonymous with the generative form of the technology, representing a sudden shift away from the previous focus on computer vision, an area where China had been leading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that shift,<strong>&nbsp;SenseTime&nbsp;</strong>(OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SNTMF#OTC\">SNTMF</a>), once hailed as one of China&rsquo;s four &ldquo;AI Dragons,&rdquo; found itself scrambling to adapt. The company swiftly decided to go all-in on generative AI, joining the earliest group of Chinese companies investing in the technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SenseTime&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2024/0827/2024082700702.pdf\">financial results</a>, announced last week, show signs of progress in the transformation. For the first half of this year, the company&rsquo;s revenue from generative AI grew sharply to account for 60.4% of its total, as the segment&rsquo;s business surged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll take a deeper dive into SenseTime&rsquo;s generative AI push shortly, including what&rsquo;s driving it and the challenges it could face in the transformation. But first we&rsquo;ll review the company&rsquo;s history and finances from the past few years, which have led to today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SenseTime initially focused on visual recognition AI after its founding in 2014, hitching its wagon to China&rsquo;s aggressive spending on surveillance systems as part of efforts to enhance public security. The company provided advanced software, including facial recognition algorithms, for integration into digital cameras and other systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend was particularly pronounced between 2019 and 2021, when the pandemic drove increased demand for such systems as China used the technology in its efforts to limit the spread of the virus. As it rode that government-led spending wave, SenseTime&rsquo;s annual revenue reached a peak of 4.7 billion yuan ($663 million) in 2021, more than double the 1.85 billion yuan in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with the pandemic fading and China&rsquo;s economy slowing, both governments and businesses have been cutting spending on security and surveillance. That took its toll on SenseTime, leading to its first annual revenue decrease in 2022. Compounding its difficulties, the company was also subject to U.S. sanctions shortly before its Hong Kong IPO in late 2021 due to the sensitive nature of its technology, cutting it off from U.S.-based investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SenseTime was never profitable to begin with, and its losses peaked in 2021 at a staggering 17 billion yuan. But as it faced the dual challenges of slowing demand and U.S. sanctions, it began focusing on controlling costs and narrowing its losses to ensure its longer-term viability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its latest financial report, SenseTime put a positive face on the ongoing decline for its &ldquo;traditional AI&rdquo; segment, mainly computer vision products, by saying it reflected a successful transition to generative AI. The traditional segment accounted for about 30% of its revenue in the first six months of this year, less than half the 73.5% it made up a year earlier when products from that segment fell under its Smart Business, Smart City, and Smart Life categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s generative AI business moved in the other direction, surging 255.7% to 1.05 billion yuan, accounting for 60.4% of its revenue. That helped to lift the company&rsquo;s total revenue for the six-month period by 21.4% to 1.7 billion yuan, putting SenseTime on track to return to annual revenue growth after two years of declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Two Focuses</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SenseTime&rsquo;s generative AI pivot focuses on two main areas. First, the company is ramping up its purchases of GPUs from manufacturers like&nbsp;<strong>Nvidia</strong>, then hosting them in data centers and renting their computing power with its own software to enterprises via cloud platforms. The business model is straightforward: acquire GPUs, set up infrastructure, and lease computing power to businesses needing AI resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second area involves development of its own large language model (LLM), SenseNova. First unveiled in April 2023, it rolled out its fifth version of the LLM in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on SenseNova, SenseTime has created a ChatGPT-like chatbot service called SenseChat. While SenseChat is currently free for public use, SenseTime monetizes the technology by selling application programming interface (API) services via its cloud platform. Such services allow enterprises and developers to leverage SenseNova to create AI applications tailored to their specific needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SenseTime cited industry data showing it has gained an early foothold in these two markets. It was the third-largest player with 15.4% of the 3.2 billion yuan AI data center service market for the second half of 2023, it said, citing IDC released last month. A separate IDC report ranked SenseTime in third place with 16% of China&rsquo;s LLM platform and applications market, which was valued at 1.8 billion yuan in the second half of 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, investors shouldn&rsquo;t get too excited just yet about such numbers, since the generative AI market in China is still in its early stages and such rankings could change dramatically in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One dynamic to consider is the fierce price war unfolding in China&rsquo;s LLM space, where developers are racing to lower prices to attract customers. In such a competitive environment, startups like SenseTime may have difficulty competing with giants like Baidu and ByteDance, which have much deeper war chests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In GPU rental services, SenseTime, like other firms in this business, is being constantly challenged by tightening restrictions from the U.S. government. Such restrictions have already led to bans on the sale of some advanced Nvidia GPUs to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the challenges, there are also some positive signs. SenseTime&rsquo;s shift and investment into generative AI doesn&rsquo;t appear to be worsening its financial losses. For the first half of 2024, the company reported a net loss of 2.5 billion yuan, narrowing from 3.1 billion a year earlier. This improvement came despite a 6% increase in R&amp;D costs and a 24% rise in the cost of sales, which includes expenses for purchasing GPUs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SenseTime&rsquo;s progress in generative AI reignited investor interest in its stock earlier this year, powering a 40% surge in the shares the day it released the latest version of SenseNova in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, investor reaction to its latest report last week suggests the momentum may be waning, with the shares edging down 1.6% the day after the report&rsquo;s release.

{"author": "Avi Kapoor", "content": "<p><strong>Hormel Foods Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HRL#NYSE\">HRL</a>) is set to release earnings results for its third quarter, after the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/HRL/earnings\">closing bell on Wednesday, Sept. 4.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Hormel Foods offers an annual dividend yield of 3.47%. That&#8217;s a quarterly dividend amount of 28.25 cents per share ($1.13 a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $172,841 or around 5,310 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $34,568 or around 1,062 shares.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To calculate: </strong>Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.13 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.13 = 5,310 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.13 = 1,062 shares ($100 per month).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How that works:</strong> The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock&#8217;s current price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HRL Price Action:</strong> Shares of Hormel Foods gained 1.1% to close at $32.55 on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts expect the Austin, Minnesota-based company to report quarterly earnings at 36 cents per share, down from 40 cents per share in the year-ago period.

Under Buffett&#39;s leadership, the company became the first non-tech firm to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, with Class A shares surpassing $700,000 each for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These achievements highlight a legacy of smart investment strategies and disciplined financial management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s journey from a struggling textile business to a major conglomerate showcases Buffett&#39;s investment skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transformation started in the mid-20th century, evolving into a giant with a diverse portfolio of over $300 billion and about $277 billion in cash reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&#39;s focus on compounding reflects Buffett&#39;s philosophy of a long-term, consistent investment approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buffett&#39;s influence goes beyond Berkshire, inspiring many investors with his strategic moves in challenging environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His notable investments include Coca-Cola in the late 1980s, Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently, technology giant Apple, though he recently sold half of those shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The performance of Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s stock demonstrates Buffett&#39;s lasting strategy. Since 1965, it has achieved an annualized return of 19.8%, significantly outperforming the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 10.2% over the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Class B shares have impressively increased by 33%, easily breaking past major resistance levels and showing the bullish behavior expected from Buffett-managed investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, investing in Berkshire requires patience, as shown by periods of consolidation like the recent one from February to July, when the stock moved between $395 and $430.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These periods of sideways movement are typical of Berkshire&#39;s path, indicating that while the stock rises over time, it also requires investor patience during slower phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2024-09-02_13-07-58_0.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u517520/2024-09-02_13-07-58_0.jpg\" style=\"height:308px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Berkshire&#39;s shares reach new highs, closing August up nearly 9%, the stock nears a psychological level of around $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investor sentiment will be key at this point. If seen as overvalued, the stock might pull back. Conversely, recognition of its true value could lead to further gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the closing bell on Friday, August 30, the stock closed at $475.92, trading up by 1.61%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

Safe haven currencies such as the yen and the U.S. dollar gained ground against their major counterparts</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LPL Financial Chief Technical Strategist <strong>Adam Turnquist</strong> flagged a potentially weak September, with flattish performance in the first half and losses accelerating into the month end. &#8221; For this year, the midway point also happens to line up closely with the September 18 Federal Open Market Committee Meeting,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has generated an average return of -0.7% in September and finished higher only 43% of the time, making it the worst month for stocks on an average return and positivity rate basis, he noted. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Futures</strong></td><td><strong>Performance (+/-)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nasdaq 100</strong></td><td>-0.84%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>S&amp;P 500</strong></td><td>-0.59%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dow</strong></td><td>-0.53%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>R2K</strong></td><td>-1.12%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In premarket trading on Tuesday,&nbsp;the<strong> SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) fell 0.49% to $560.90, and the&nbsp;<strong>Invesco QQQ ETF</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ\">QQQ</a>) slid 0.67% to $473.09, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/lxquj26b2sag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Pro data</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cues From Last Week:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nvidia Corp.&#8217;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) earnings proved to be a dampener for the market in the week ended Aug. 30, as stocks stalled ahead of the report and pulled back after the report. Some offsetting impact came from the annual rate of the core personal consumption expenditure index &#8211; the Fed&#8217;s favorite inflation gauge, which came in a bit below estimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dow Industrials weathered the weaker sentiment and ended the week at a record high and the S&amp;P 500 Index rose modestly, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a weekly loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major indices closed August in the green despite the turbulence seen early in the month following the unwinding of yen carry trades but small-caps had a down month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Index</strong></td><td><strong>Weekly</strong> <strong>Performance (+/)</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td><td><strong>August Performance</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nasdaq Composite</strong></td><td>-0.92%</td><td>17,713.62</td><td>+0.65%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong></td><td>+0.25%</td><td>5,648.40</td><td>+2.28%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dow Industrials</strong></td><td>+0.94%</td><td>41,563.08</td><td>+1.76%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Russell 2000</strong></td><td>-0.05%</td><td>2,217.63</td><td>-1.64%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Insights From Analysts</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk-reward for the market is currently unattractive, according to wealth management company Lumida Wealth founder Ram Ahluwalia. Most names do not have attractive valuations and so there is nothing to buy, he said. Artificial intelligence, which has been one of the major market drivers, may cease to be a catalyst, he added, citing recent not-so-positive reports on the technology by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market has discounted a 50 basis-point rate cut in September, Ahluwalia said, adding that this will unlikely materialize. He sees a nice non-farm payrolls report for August. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a market on \u2018accelerated time'. The hot ball of liquidity is making moves up and down faster than most people are accustomed to as those moves ordinarily would play out over a longer time frame,&#8221; he said. The wealth manager recommended tactically reducing a net long exposure until earnings season starts in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Upcoming Economic Data</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday&#8217;s non-farm payrolls report for August, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a few private sector activity readings, the Fed&#8217;s Beige Book and a few Fed speeches are on the investors&#8217; radar this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>S&amp;P Global will release its final manufacturing purchasing managers&#8217; index for August at 9:45 a.m. EDT.

Although there has been a slight recovery from earlier lows, the overall market sentiment remains bearish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors are reacting to recent data from OPEC, which indicates that 8 OPEC+ members plan to increase their production by 180,000 barrels per day. This anticipated rise in supply casts a shadow over the oil market, particularly as it coincides with weakening demand indicators from major economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A report from the Department of Energy in the US highlighted a drop in oil consumption in June to levels not seen since the summer of 2020, considering seasonal adjustments. This downturn in demand is mirrored by troubling economic data from China, where factory activity has reportedly reached a six-month low. Moreover, the decline in selling prices and a reduction in new orders from Chinese manufacturing sectors add to the pessimism surrounding future demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some support for oil prices stems from production issues in Libya, where the largest local oilfield has halted production due to state-imposed force majeure. This disruption could pose supply challenges for major oil consumers and as highlighted in <a href=\"https://roboforex.com/beginners/analytics/forex-forecast/commodities/?utm_source=benzinga.com&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=rf_en_external_article_03092024&amp;utm_content=analysis&amp;utm_term=forecast\">commodities analysis</a>, temporarily cushion the impact of broader negative trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Brent Technical Analysis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/brenth4_57.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/brenth4_57.png\" style=\"height:275px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The H4 chart shows a previous growth impulse peaking at 81.85, followed by a correction down to 75.20, forming a broad consolidation range at this lower level. There is an expectation for a growth move towards 79.00 today. If this level is breached upward, it may signal the continuation of the growth wave to 82.87. This bullish scenario is tentatively supported by the MACD indicator, whose signal line is below zero but shows signs of an upward trajectory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/brenth1_56.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/brenth1_56.png\" style=\"height:275px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the H1 chart, Brent has formed a corrective structure down to 76.02 and is currently developing a growth structure towards 77.55. A successful breach of this level could open the way for further growth to 79.00, potentially continuing to 82.87. The Stochastic oscillator supports this outlook, with its signal line positioned around 50 and pointing upwards, indicating potential for further price increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, while the short-term technical indicators suggest a possible recovery in Brent prices, the broader market context remains challenging due to increased supply forecasts and weak demand signals from vital global markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disclaimer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author&#39;s particular opinion.

{"author": "Abbey Higginbotham", "content": "<p>As the cannabis industry faces ongoing regulatory challenges, financial constraints remain a significant obstacle to growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ross Gerber</strong>, co-founder and CEO of <strong>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management</strong> and upcoming speaker at <strong>Benzinga&#8217;s Cannabis Capital Conference</strong>, shared his views on the financial difficulties confronting cannabis companies, especially in light of potential federal rescheduling and its effects on accessing capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rescheduling and Its Potential Impact</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber sees federal rescheduling as a critical moment for the cannabis industry. He pointed out that many cannabis companies are well-managed but are forced to operate within an &#8220;absurd tax environment and regulatory department.&#8221; He believes that removing cannabis from the Schedule I classification would lead to a &#8220;dramatic improvement in financial performance for the companies.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, cannabis is still federally illegal and classified as a Schedule I substance, which severely limits the industry&#8217;s ability to function like other businesses. Gerber emphasized that if cannabis were rescheduled to a lower category, such as Schedule III, the shift would relieve many of the financial burdens these companies currently face.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Access to Capital: The Path to Growth</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A major challenge for cannabis companies, according to Gerber, is the difficulty in securing capital due to their federal status. These companies often have to borrow at high interest rates because they cannot access traditional banking services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber noted, &#8220;A private [investor] might say, \u2018Oh, I can lend to Green Thumb, which is just a really great company, and I could probably get seven or 8% from them, guaranteed with assets versus the 12 or 15% they&#8217;re paying today.'\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further highlighted that if rescheduling happens, the reduction in taxes and interest expenses could &#8220;at least double the value of your typical cannabis company.&#8221; He says this change would benefit the companies and potentially attract more institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the market due to its current legal hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Preparing for a Post-Rescheduling Future</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While rescheduling could bring about considerable changes, Gerber cautioned that the benefits might not be immediately visible.

{"author": "Zaheer Anwari", "content": "<ul>\r\n\t<li>Netflix is approaching a major psychological resistance level at $700, a point that has previously influenced investor sentiment and led to significant sell-offs.</li>\r\n\t<li>The stock has seen an impressive historical performance, increasing by over 8000% from 2011 to 2021.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychological resistance levels often serve as strong barriers that can influence investor sentiment. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ\">NFLX</a>) is now on the verge of a major breakthrough, challenging a significant resistance point at $700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&#39;t just a number but a psychological hurdle that has significantly impacted the stock&#39;s path. Historically, Netflix&#39;s stock journey has been remarkable, growing over 8000% between 2011 and 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the $700 level has been a critical point. Previously, hitting this price triggered a major sell-off, causing a 76% drop that bottomed out in May 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sharp decline highlights the impact of this resistance level and the caution investors feel when reaching this point. Currently, Netflix&#39;s stock has hovered around the $700 mark for almost two months, showing a tense standoff between bullish hopes and bearish caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock&#39;s first attempt to break through this level was on July 5, when it jumped 28% from around $550 but hit resistance at $700. This led to a 15% drop, with prices falling just below $600 before rallying again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ongoing struggle to surpass the $700 mark has led to a period of consolidation, with investors watching closely for signs of a breakout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock&#39;s second attempt to exceed this threshold shows a more sustained effort, reflecting the growing determination among buyers to push beyond previous highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock&#39;s recent performance highlights anticipation of a breakout. In August, Netflix&#39;s stock price rose by 11%, contributing to a 44% increase for the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This positive momentum might be the catalyst needed for the stock to finally break past the $700 resistance level. Investors and analysts are attentively observing Netflix&#39;s stock developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2024-09-03_09-43-21.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u517520/2024-09-03_09-43-21.jpg\" style=\"height:308px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A successful move above $700 could trigger a strong upward trend, benefiting those who endured uncertainty. On the other hand, failing to break through could result in a repetition of past patterns, where significant declines followed attempts to reach this level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If buyers can gather enough momentum to propel the stock beyond $700, it may lead to a strong long-term upward trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

{"author": "Bibhu Pattnaik", "content": "<p><strong>Mark Cuban</strong>, the owner of the <strong>Dallas Mavericks</strong>, has revealed a revamped offensive role <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/02/30870136/mark-cuban-shares-biggest-misconception-about-becoming-super-rich-and-how-his-friend-feel-about-it-1\">for the team&#8217;s new acquisition, <strong>Klay Thompson</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> During an episode of Jalen Brunson's Roommates Show podcast, Cuban shared his vision for Thompson&#8217;s role in the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9H-9u9EZ1k&amp;feature=youtu.be\">show</a>, he indicated that Thompson&#8217;s responsibilities on the court will be significantly less than what he had at the Golden State Warriors. Cuban&#8217;s plan for the upcoming NBA season is to utilize Thompson&#8217;s renowned sharpshooting skills in a &#8220;catch and shoot&#8221; capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thompson, aged 34, signed a three-year, $50 million contract with the Mavericks in July, marking the end of his tenure with the Warriors, his only previous team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Obviously, the big addition was Klay. Just somebody who you have to face guard, who's going to make 40%. You know at Golden State, he had to always be on the move. They had that motion offense where he was always coming off the screens and running, &#8221; Cuban said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/06/39241650/heres-how-mark-cuban-made-91-of-his-employees-millionaires\">Here&#8217;s How Mark Cuban Made 91% Of His Employees Millionaires</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We don't do that, or not nearly as much. I'm sure we'll run some of that action for him, but just standing in the corner and standing in the wings, and just catch and shoot from Luka and Ky. Hopefully his life is going to be a lot easier,\" he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a decline in his shooting performance in the last season, Thompson is still considered a formidable outside threat with his ability to stretch defenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Cuban, Thompson&#8217;s role will be more simplified, which could prove beneficial for the Mavericks. This comes in light of Thompson&#8217;s recent slump in performance, where he posted his lowest scoring output since the 2012-13 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/03/38013062/mark-cuban-reveals-the-one-reason-he-wont-vote-for-donald-trump-and-why-joe-biden-is-the-better-lead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mark Cuban Reveals The One Reason He Won't Vote For Donald Trump And Why Joe Biden Is The Better Leader: \u2018To Me, That Says Everything'</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Thompson&#8217;s move to the Mavericks and the subsequent shift in his role signifies a strategic change for the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His simplified &#8220;catch and shoot&#8221; role could potentially maximize his shooting prowess while minimizing the pressure on him. This could lead to a resurgence in his performance, which dipped last season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Thompson&#8217;s experience and skills could prove instrumental in bolstering the Mavericks&#8217; offensive capabilities. This strategic move by Cuban could be a game-changer for the Mavericks in the upcoming NBA season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Next:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40543916/mark-cuban-backs-kamala-harris-seeing-a-new-business-friendly-democratic-party\">Mark Cuban Backs Kamala Harris, Seeing A New Business-Friendly Democratic Party</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was partially produced with the help of&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Benzinga Neuro</em></a><em>&nbsp;and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-31T15:45:00Z", "headline": "Mark Cuban's NBA Strategy for Klay Thompson With Mavericks: 'Obviously The Big Addition Was Klay, Hopefully His Life Is Going To Be A Lot Easier'", "id": 40666713, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Dallas-Mavericks-v-Miami-Heat---Game-Six.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Dallas-Mavericks-v-Miami-Heat---Game-Six.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Dallas-Mavericks-v-Miami-Heat---Game-Six.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, has revealed a revamped offensive role for the team&#39;s new acquisition, Klay Thompson.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T14:18:15Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40666713/mark-cubans-nba-strategy-for-klay-thompson-with-mavericks-obviously-the-big-addition-was-klay-hopefu"}

{"author": "RIPS", "content": "<p>Good Morning Traders! In today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#39;s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#39;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The SPY is currently positioned near our key level of 560.83. For the bulls, a move higher towards 561.90 is what we&#39;re looking for to gauge strength. Should buyers manage to maintain control above this level, we anticipate a rise towards our next support level at 563.23. If this area holds firm during regular trading hours, it could set the stage for a further advance to 564.29. The high bull target for today stands at 565.38.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, if 560.83 fails to act as support, the bears may take the reins and push the price down to test 559.75. Should selling pressure intensify, a further drop towards 558.32 could be in play. Continued bearish momentum could see a deeper decline to 557.44. If the session turns sharply negative, our low bear target for SPY today is set at 556.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The QQQ is currently hovering around our critical level of 474.66. For bullish traders, the focus will be on seeing buyers defend this level and push the price up towards 476.85. If buying activity remains strong, we could see an advance to the 479.03 level. Sustained bullish momentum might drive the price even higher, with the next target being 481.73. The high bull target for the day is positioned at 483.95.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if 474.66 proves to be weak support and fails to hold, the bears may capitalize on this and drive the price lower towards 471.33. Should selling pressure continue, a test of 469.27 could be expected. If the downward trend persists, we might see the price move further down to 467.60. Our low bear target for QQQ today is set at 465.93, should the bearish forces dominate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apple Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple is currently trading around our level of 227.82. Bulls will be watching to see if this level can serve as a solid support base. If it does, a push towards 229.03 is likely. Continued buying strength could propel the price to 230.25. If the bulls manage to maintain control throughout the session, we could see Apple reach our high bull target for the day at 231.76.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, however, 227.82 fails to hold as support, bears may drive the price lower, initially targeting 226.90. Persistent selling could lead to a decline towards 226.08. Should the bearish momentum continue, the price may drop further to 225.31. The low bear target for Apple today is set at 223.87, reflecting a potential sharp sell-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft is currently around our important level of 416.32. For the bulls, the key is to hold this level and push higher towards 417.25. If this level holds as support, it could pave the way for a rally towards 419.17. Sustained buying pressure may see the price reaching our high bull target for the day at 420.26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 416.32 does not hold, bears might push the price down to test the 414.56 level. If selling intensifies, the next level to watch is 413.14. A continued downward move could see the price fall to 411.72. Our low bear target for Microsoft today is at 410.64, which would mark a significant downturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NVIDIA is currently trading near our key level of 116.61. For the bulls, the goal is to push the price up to 117.86 and secure it as a new support level. If successful, we could see a move up to 119.44. Continued buying interest might drive the price even higher, with a potential rally to 120.27. The high bull target for NVIDIA today is set at 121.97.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the downside, if 116.61 fails to hold, bears may test the lower level of 115.83. If this level is breached, the next target could be 115.15. Continued bearish pressure might drive the price further down to 114.29. Should the selling continue, the low bear target for NVIDIA today is at 113.68.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alphabet is currently positioned around our key level of 161.79. Bulls will be looking for this level to act as strong support and drive the price higher towards 163.79. If buying momentum persists, we could see the price advance to our high bull target of 165.41.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if 161.79 fails to hold as support, bears might step in and push the price down towards 160.36. A breakdown of this level could lead to a further decline to 158.54. If selling pressure remains strong, the price may drop to our low bear target for Alphabet today at 157.41.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta is currently auctioning around 515.39. For bullish traders, a move up towards 520.27 will be critical, especially if this level can hold as support. If the buying momentum continues, we might see an advance to 526.29. A strong uptrend could see the price rally further to 531.03. The high bull target for Meta today is at 534.33.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if 515.39 doesn&#39;t hold, the bears may take over, driving the price down to 512.85. Should the selling continue, we might see a test of 508.25. A breakdown of this level could lead to a further decline to 504.54, which is our low bear target for Meta today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tesla Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla is currently trading near our key level of 213.88. Bulls will aim for a move up towards 216.31. If the price holds at this level, we could see a rally towards 217.78. Should the market exhibit strong bullish tendencies today, Tesla might test higher levels at 219.39, with the high bull target for the day set at 220.65.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 213.88 doesn&#39;t hold as support, bears may push the price lower to test 211.53. Continued selling pressure could drive the price down to 209.51. If this level is breached, the low bear target for Tesla today is set at 206.71, indicating a potential sharp decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Word: As we kick off this shortened trading week, today&#39;s session is packed with crucial data that could significantly influence market movements. Starting at 9:45 AM ET, we have the final S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI for August, which will provide insights into the manufacturing sector&#39;s health.

Given the array of data releases, traders should be prepared for heightened volatility.

If you're serious about the business, you can't afford to miss out.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Groundbreaking LOVR Material</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 100% biological material, called LOVR \u2013 \"leather-free, oil-free, vegan and residue-based,\" is made from industrial hemp grown for the food industry. Material made from 100% bio-based hemp uses residues of the regional hemp industry. It can be produced on existing industrial plants and recycled or composted at the end of its service life in an automobile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\"Our innovative surface material called LOVR that we are developing and testing for the automotive industry in cooperation with Volkswagen is scalable and groundbreaking for sustainability in the automotive sector,\" <strong>Lucas Fuhrmann, </strong>CEO and co-founder Revoltech GmbH said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first presentations of the innovative material have already received positive responses and feedback from customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"In our search for new materials, we are very open to new ideas from many different industries. At Technical Development, we place a strong focus on innovative, creative and sustainable solutions for holistic, resource-saving vehicle development,\" said <strong>Kai Gr\u00fcnitz, </strong>Volkswagen brand board member for technical development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other automotive giants have already researched or used these hemp-based materials in their cars. For example, <strong>BMW</strong>'s (OTCPK:BMWYY) i3 electric cars have door panels made from a combination of hemp, natural fibers and a bio-based plastic, <a href=\"https://hemptoday.net/volkswagen-says-it-is-developing-hemp-fiber-based-material-to-replace-faux-leather/\">writes</a> Hemp Today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ford</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/F#NYSE\">F</a>) is known for experimenting with sustainable materials, including hemp. Its famous model Ford Focus has natural fiver composites in its interior. <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> (OTCPK:MBGAF), as well, included hemp-based material in various parts of its cars' interiors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hemp's Versatility</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hemp has the ability to blend with various polymers, which makes it suitable for various exterior applications. Used in composites, hemp fibers enhance the stiffness and strength of structural parts of a car, improving crash performance and overall structural integrity, writes the outlet. Furthermore, hemp fibers are known to be solid insulators, which is why are used in panels and materials that need to have soundproofing and thermal properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Material made from industrial hemp is also used in construction building and is called hempcrete.

Dart said the &#8220;the tripling in central bank purchases since mid-2022 on fears about U.S. financial sanctions and U.S. sovereign debt is structural and will continue, reported or unreported.&#8221; This trend is expected to persist, potentially driving gold prices higher if new geopolitical or financial shocks emerge.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fed Rate Cuts:</strong> The anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are poised to attract Western capital back into the gold market, a factor largely absent from the sharp gold rally seen over the past two years. This influx of capital could further propel gold prices upward.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hedge Against Geopolitical Risks:</strong> Gold remains a valuable hedge against geopolitical shocks, including tariffs, Fed subordination risks and debt fears.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs acknowledges the impact of the price-sensitive Chinese market, which has tempered the bank&#8217;s timeline for reaching the $2,700 target. While the recent price rally may have slowed demand from China, Goldman said this sensitivity will also &#8220;insure against hypothetical large price declines,&#8221; as lower prices would likely trigger renewed buying interest from Chinese investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Eyes On September Stock Volatility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>September is usually a seasonally weak period for U.S. equities, according to the World Gold Council. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this context, &#8220;gold's typically strong negative correlation during equity sell-offs should sustain investor interest,&#8221; especially given the elevated uncertainty and event risk, which are expected to keep gold attractive to investors, the council said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 index, as tracked by the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>), has generated an average return of negative 0.7% in September, finishing higher <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/09/40676774/september-market-seasonality-why-this-month-is-historically-the-toughest-for-investors\">only 43% of the time</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last four Septembers have been particularly difficult for the S&amp;P 500, with significant declines of 4.9% in 2022, 9.3% in 2021, 4.8% in 2020 and 3.9% in 2019. This trend of poor performance may push investors toward gold as a safe-haven asset during this notoriously tough month for equities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A seasonality analysis over the past 48 years reveals that September has historically been a favorable month for gold. The metal has posted an average gain of 0.63% in September, making it one of gold&#8217;s strongest months, trailing only August&#8217;s 0.64% increase and January&#8217;s 0.76% surge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chart: September Traditionally A Positive Month For Gold</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03091451/image-11-1024x508.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-527002\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03091451/image-11-1024x508.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03091451/image-11-300x149.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03091451/image-11-768x381.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03091451/image-11-1536x762.png 1536w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03091451/image-11.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40676319/real-estate-etfs-see-longest-inflow-streak-since-march-2022-as-investors-jump-on-the-rate-cut-ba\">Real Estate ETFs See Longest Inflow Streak Since March 2022 As Investors Jump On The Rate Cut Bandwagon</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock. </em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T14:39:27Z", "headline": "Goldman Sachs Bullish On Gold: Wall Street Giant Targets $2,700 By Early 2025, Driven By Geopolitical Risks, Fed Rate Cuts", "id": 40689742, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Gold-Nuggets-Isolated-On-Black-Backgroun.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Gold-Nuggets-Isolated-On-Black-Backgroun.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Gold-Nuggets-Isolated-On-Black-Backgroun.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Goldman Sachs sees gold surging to $2,700/oz. by early 2025, backed by central bank demand and Fed rate cuts.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; </strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

These include, \"1) the Fed starting to reverse course from hawkish to dovish, 2) outcome of the U.S. election and effect on policy, 3) ongoing global geopolitical risk, and 4) fears of a recession.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market's swift transition from risk-on to risk-off sentiment in August, with the VIX spiking into the 60s, underscores the volatility driven by these factors.

during the calendar month. The company beat estimates from analysts and shared guidance that was ahead of estimates. The stock has consistently ranked as one of the top three most-searched tickers on Benzinga Pro in each month this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla, which topped the month of July, fell to third place for the month of August. The electric vehicle stock has ranked among the four most-searched tickers each month during 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two ETFs were among the most-searched tickers in August, with SPY ranking second and QQQ ranking ninth. The SPY, which tracks the S&amp;P 500, regularly ranks as one of the top three most searched tickers each month. The QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, saw a boost in August, re-joining the top 10 for the first time since May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super Micro Computer saw a surge in interest in August, likely boosted<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/short-ideas/24/08/40579899/super-micro-computer-stock-falls-on-short-report-hindenburg-says-company-has-accounting\"> by a short report </a>and an update from the company. The stock previously ranked as high as fifth in March before the fourth-place ranking in August. The stock moved back into the top 10 for the first time since June's 10th place ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two newcomers joined the top 10 most searched tickers list, with Lumen Technologies ranking fifth and GeoVax Labs ranking 10<sup>th</sup>. Lumen <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40221474/lumen-technologies-stock-continues-to-soar-whats-going-on\">reported quarterly financial results</a> during the month and saw shares soar and gain interest from investors. GeoVax Labs saw high volatility and increased interest related to the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/health-care/24/08/40381585/who-declares-mpox-public-health-emergency-coordinated-international-response-essential-to-hal\"> emergency health declaration </a>by the World Health Organization on mpox. GeoVax Labs has vaccines that are said to be effective against mpox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Falling out of the top 10 were <strong>Serve Robotics</strong>, which ranked 16<sup>th</sup> in August and <strong>Zapp Electric Vehicles</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ZAPP#NASDAQ\">ZAPP</a>), which did not rank in the top 20 for August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<strong> iShares Russell 2000 ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IWM#NYSE\">IWM</a>) continues to see strong interest from readers.

I've been trying to hit 80 hot dogs for years. Without Kobayashi, I was never able to do it. He drives it.

{"author": "Vaishali Prayag", "content": "<p><strong>Broadcom Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AVGO#NASDAQ\">AVGO</a>) shares are down Monday. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40684198/nvidia-tsmc-lead-chip-stocks-lower-in-premarket-whats-going-on\">what you need to know.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Happening</strong>: Broadcom is set to report its third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, September 5th. Market analysts have projected an estimated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20, alongside expected revenue of $12.96 billion. This upcoming earnings report has the potential to provide critical insights into Broadcom's financial health and its outlook for the remainder of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recent Developments</strong>: In addition to the earnings anticipation, Broadcom has also garnered attention following a recent disclosure from former House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi.</strong> Pelosi revealed an investment in the company, which includes the purchase of call options on Broadcom, with the strike price adjusted to $80 following a 10-for-1 stock split. These options are set to expire in June 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The semiconductor sector has also been under pressure recently and <strong>Nvidia Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>), a key player and leader in the industry, has seen a sell-off that appears to be dragging down related stocks, including Broadcom. Given Broadcom's significant role within the semiconductor space, the company is often seen as a bellwether for the industry, meaning that negative trends in leading stocks like Nvidia can weigh heavily on Broadcom&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technical Analysis</strong>: From a technical perspective, Broadcom&#8217;s stock is showing some interesting signals. According to a chart analysis by TrendSpider, Broadcom is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which is typically seen as a bullish indicator. This pattern suggests the potential for a trend reversal from bearish to bullish, which could offer some hope for investors looking for a rebound in the stock's price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AVGO Price Action</strong>: As of the latest trading, Broadcom shares have fallen 5.19% to $154.42 according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/?utm_source=BZprocontent090324&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03101342/AVGO-1024x534.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-527173\" style=\"width:434px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03101342/AVGO-1024x534.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03101342/AVGO-300x156.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03101342/AVGO-768x401.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03101342/AVGO.png 1087w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/09/40688891/zscaler-gears-up-for-q4-print-here-are-the-recent-forecast-changes-from-wall-streets-most-accurate-\">Zscaler Gears Up For Q4 Print; Here Are The Recent Forecast Changes From Wall Street&#8217;s Most Accurate Analysts</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image Via Shutterstock.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T16:31:33Z", "headline": "What's Going On With Broadcom Shares Today?", "id": 40692177, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Broadcom--Shutterstock.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Broadcom--Shutterstock.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Broadcom--Shutterstock.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Broadcom Inc.

For comparison, FanDuel is also offering $250 in free bets along with a three-week free trial of NFL Sunday Ticket. The $250 is higher than $200 offered by both last year, the analyst noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rival Fanatics is listed as the most generous to start the season with $1,000 in matching free bets over a 10-day period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FanDuel app beat out DraftKings in the last NFL season, with the ESPN Bet app from <strong>Penn Entertainment Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PENN#NASDAQ\">PENN</a>) topping the category after it launched in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the 2024 NFL season, FanDuel ranks ahead of DraftKings with Fanatics and BetMGM ranking third and fourth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESPN, which is owned by <strong>Walt Disney Co </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DIS#NYSE\">DIS</a>) has the top sports media and fantasy sports apps heading into the season.

FanDuel also led in the first and second quarters with 38.7% and 37.3% compared to 34.4% and 37.0%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DraftKings got closer to FanDuel in the second quarter and the third quarter could be a key time for the two operators with NFL and NCAA Football back in full action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESPN Bet had 3.2% market share in 2024 and market share of 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively, in the first two quarters of 2024. The Penn product continues to see minimal market share despite the large audience ESPN commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ranking third was BetMGM, a joint venture from <strong>Entain </strong>and<strong> MGM Resorts International </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MGM#NYSE\">MGM</a>). BetMGM had a market share of 8.6% in 2023 and posted a market share of 7.9% in both the first and second quarters. While BetMGM ranks third, the brand has also seen its market share fall from 12.1% in 2022 as DraftKings and FanDuel continue to gain share against the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there have been several competitors launching against DraftKings and FanDuel over the years, the two leaders have been able to fend them off and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Within this market, we believe DKNG has a sustainable customer acquisition strategy that should continue to drive its first- or second-place position in all states.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DKNG Price Action:</strong> DraftKings stock trades at $34.51 versus a 52-week trading range of $25.74 to $49.57.

{"author": "Piero Cingari", "content": "<p>The Japanese yen sent shockwaves through the markets at the start of September, triggering alarms for traders already on edge in what is shaping up to be <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/09/40676774/september-market-seasonality-why-this-month-is-historically-the-toughest-for-investors\">a highly volatile month.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The yen, as tracked by the <strong>Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FXY#NYSE\">FXY</a>), appreciated over 0.9% by 11:30 a.m. ET, fueled by hawkish remarks overnight from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor <strong>Kazuo Ueda</strong> and disappointing U.S. manufacturing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a parliamentary speech Tuesday, Ueda reaffirmed that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates if the economy and inflation evolve as expected. Ueda reiterated that the economic environment remains accommodative, despite the July rate hike, as real interest rates continue to be significantly negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Traders hoping for a dovish pivot didn't get it,&#8221; said analyst <strong>Michael Gayed</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Gayed, with the Federal Reserve likely to cut rates by 75-100 basis points by the end of the year and the BoJ potentially hiking at least once more during the same period, the interest rate gap could narrow significantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gayed also added, &#8220;This could ultimately trigger the next rally for the yen and potentially drive stock prices higher in the longer term.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">US Manufacturing Sector Contracts, Analysts See Mixed Yen Performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, the U.S. manufacturing sector remained in a contractionary phase for the fifth consecutive month. However, the pace of decline eased slightly compared to July, according to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/09/40689835/us-manufacturing-activity-extends-contraction-for-fifth-month-demand-continues-to\">Institute for Supply Management (ISM)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This should be positive news for equities and keeps the door open for more rate cuts,&#8221; said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, commented, &#8220;Manufacturing employment contracted for the third consecutive month as activity in the sector slowed. While manufacturing now represents a smaller portion of the macroeconomy than in previous cycles, investors should still prepare for a broader slowdown throughout the remainder of the year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treasury yields fell sharply following Tuesday&#8217;s data release. The yield on the 10-year bond fell 7 basis points to 3.85%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg reported that Arif Husain, head of fixed income at T. Rowe Price, expects further volatility as the yen-dollar carry trade unwinds, predicting more episodes similar to the one seen in early August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Husain believes the yen is on an appreciating trend due to Japan&#8217;s ongoing structural transformation, driven by demographic shifts. He also highlighted that persistent inflation is likely to accelerate corporate reforms and influence household asset allocation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ideal macro environment for yen appreciation usually occurs when U.S. real rates and equities decline together, typically during a U.S. recession,&#8221; said Kamakshya Trivedi, an economist at Goldman Sachs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrarily, Daysuke Takato, an economist at Bank of America, argued, &#8220;The yen&#8217;s weakness has been driven by two main factors: the interest rate differentials between Japan and the rest of the world, and structural capital outflows from Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the potential for further yen depreciation may be limited in the short term, we believe the yen will resume its downtrend by year-end, as structural outflows persist.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40689742/goldman-sachs-bullish-on-gold-wall-street-giant-targets-2-700-by-early-2025-driven-\">Goldman Sachs Bullish On Gold: Wall Street Giant Targets $2,700 By Early 2025, Driven By Geopolitical Risks, Fed Rate Cuts</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T16:55:45Z", "headline": "Japanese Yen Rallies On Bank Of Japan's Rate Hike Pledge, US Manufacturing Activity Contraction", "id": 40692633, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Japanese-Yen-Bank-Note-With-Stock-Graph-.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Japanese-Yen-Bank-Note-With-Stock-Graph-.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Japanese-Yen-Bank-Note-With-Stock-Graph-.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "  Japanese Yen Appreciates as Central Bank Governor Reaffirms Hawkish Stance and US Manufacturing Data DisappointsYen shockwaves hit volatile markets as Japan&#39;s bank governor remains hawkish and US manufacturing data disappoints, sparking potential for rally.", "symbols": ["FXY"], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T16:55:45Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/asia/24/09/40692633/japanese-yen-rallies-on-bank-of-japans-rate-hike-pledge-us-manufacturing-activity-contraction"}

{"author": "Abbey Higginbotham", "content": "<p>As the cannabis industry continues to expand, <strong>hemp&#8217;s</strong> role remains critical yet often overlooked. <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>Ross Gerber</strong>, co-founder</span> and CEO of <strong>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management</strong> and upcoming speaker at the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/cannabis-conference/\">&nbsp;<strong>Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</strong></a>, recently shared his thoughts on hemp's legal status and its importance within the broader cannabis conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hemp&#8217;s Legal Status: A Missed Opportunity?</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber, a vocal advocate for cannabis legalization, expressed frustration over the ongoing legal restrictions surrounding hemp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Hemp should be legal, right? I mean, it doesn't make any sense that hemp isn't legal,\" he stated. This sentiment highlights the confusion and missed opportunities that persist despite the legalization efforts that have taken place in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hemp, a non-psychoactive variety of the Cannabis sativa plant, has a long history in American agriculture. It was once a staple crop, used for its fibers, seeds, and oils in various industries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber reflected on this historical context, saying, \"If you go back to America in 1790, like, hemp was legal, we used hemp, like, a useful thing. Cannabis is one of the best plants in the world.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His remarks underscore the plant's versatility and the potential benefits that could be harnessed if the legal framework were more supportive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Historical Roots of Hemp Prohibition</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its numerous industrial applications, hemp was swept up in the broader prohibition of cannabis in the 20th century. According to Gerber, this decision was influenced by xenophobia and racial prejudice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It was based on xenophobia, you know, it's based off fear of immigrants&#8230; hemp is their drug, and we must make it illegal,\" he explained. According to Gerber, this historical context sheds light on the ongoing challenges advocates face working to legalize and integrate hemp into the modern economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hemp's Place in the Industry</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, hemp is legal under the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/2018-farm-bill\">2018 Farm Bill</a>, which allows for its cultivation under certain regulations. However, the stigma and regulatory hurdles continue to limit its potential. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber believes recognizing hemp's historical significance and practical benefits is key to advancing its role in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Cannabis is one of the best plants in the world,\" he emphasized, pointing out that hemp's versatility makes it an invaluable resource for various industries, including textiles, construction, and biofuels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Gerber prepares to speak at the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</a>, his views on hemp offer a timely reminder of the work that remains to be done in the cannabis industry. The conference will provide a platform for industry leaders to discuss the evolving landscape and hemp&#8217;s role in shaping the future of cannabis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo</em>: <em>Matteo Paganelli on Unsplash</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T17:02:41Z", "headline": "The Overlooked Power Of Hemp: Ross Gerber Discusses Legal, Economic Benefits", "id": 40692775, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/hemp-production.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/hemp-production.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/hemp-production.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Hemp&#39;s importance in cannabis industry often ignored.

{"author": "Benzinga Insights", "content": "<p><strong>GameStop's</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GME#NYSE\">GME</a>) short percent of float has fallen 5.2% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>35.97 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 10.21% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 5.6 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>GameStop Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1725383710_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for GameStop has declined since its last report.

The Magnificent Seven, tracked by the <strong>Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MAGS#NYSE\">MAGS</a>), offered no safe haven, declining 2.3%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;fear gauge,&#8221; surged by 20%, reflecting heightened anxiety among investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech stocks were hit hard, with the Nasdaq 100 down 2.5%, on track for its worst one-day drop since Aug. 1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuesday&#8217;s selloff was reminiscent of the market turmoil caused by the unwinding of the yen-dollar carry trade earlier in the summer.

People who bought at the top of the first peak try to sell when the stock returns to the peak's level. If there are enough of these sell orders it will create resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's also why there tends to be resistance at levels that were support. If the support breaks and the stock heads lower, some who bought before it broke will try to sell if the stock rallies back to their buy price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are enough of these remorseful buyers placing sell orders it could convert what had been support into resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a stock closes at one price and opens at a different price it will appear as a blank space or \u2018gap' on the chart.

This means if the shares eventually reverse and start to move up through the levels they gapped down through, there may not be many people who would like to sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the buyers will need to pay successively higher prices if they want to acquire shares.

{"author": "Adam Eckert", "content": "<p>Deepwater Asset Management&#8217;s\u00a0<strong>Gene Munster</strong>\u00a0was asked Tuesday morning if he would buy, sell or hold big tech stocks at current levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He emphatically recommended buying the Magnificent Seven, specifically highlighting <strong>Apple Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) and <strong>NVIDIA Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) as being positioned for significant upside <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40151107/tech-sell-off-takes-qqq-to-correction-territory-nvidia-sheds-over-5-for-week-analys\">over the coming years</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What To Know:</strong> Tuesday on CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Squawk Box,&#8221; Munster argued mega-cap tech stocks are still in the beginning stages of a massive bull run being driven by <a href=\"http://benzinga.com/topic/AI\">AI</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am a buyer here. I continue to believe we&#8217;re in the first stage \u2014 this may be hard to wrap many heads around \u2014 first stage of a three- to five-year bull market,&#8221; Munster said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Munster is bullish even in the near term as there are multiple upcoming catalysts that are likely to help push stocks higher in September, he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Munster expects anticipation over <strong>Tesla Inc&#8217;s </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) upcoming <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40665129/tesla-considers-warner-bros-studio-for-highly-anticipated-robotaxi-unveiling-event-report\">autonomous vehicle event</a> to start building this month. The analyst expects investors to begin changing how they view Nvidia and Munster also highlighted Apple&#8217;s upcoming event on Sept. 9 in which the company is expected to unveil new AI features for its smartphones and introduce the iPhone 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think when you put those three kind of cornerstone elements together, I think you are going to continue to see the tech trade move higher in the month of September,&#8221; Munster said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40680965/brazil-considers-tax-on-big-tech-companies-to-meet-2025-fiscal-goals-after-banning-elon-musks-x-and\">Brazil Considers Tax On Big Tech Companies To Meet 2025 Fiscal Goals After Banning Elon Musk&#8217;s X And Freezing Finances Of Starlink</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s September event is the biggest of the last decade, according to Munster. He expects Apple&#8217;s new AI functionality to drive a huge upgrade cycle similar to what happened when the company introduced larger screens on the iPhone 6. That upgrade cycle should help push shares higher, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ultimately I believe that this can go much higher. I think if you look at what happened [with the iPhone 5] a decade ago, it was up 12%. With the iPhone 6, it was up 52%, it just absolutely ripped,&#8221; Munster said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the new AI features are as strong as Munster believes they will be, he expects consumers to view them as &#8220;must-have.&#8221; If just 10% of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/apple-iphone\">iPhone </a>users expected to upgrade in 2026 end up upgrading early in 2025 to gain access to the AI features, iPhone growth will climb to 15% next year versus Street estimates of 7%, the analyst explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think consumers, overwhelmingly, are going to embrace these features.

Before the NFL Playoffs kick off there is the regular season with each team playing 17 games, starting with all 32 teams in action for the first week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the Week 1 matchups and the betting odds from sportsbook <strong>DraftKings Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DKNG#NASDAQ\">DKNG</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Baltimore Ravens at Kansas City Chiefs -3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Green Bay Packers at (in Brazil) Philadelphia Eagles -3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Arizona Cardinals at Buffalo Bills -6</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Houston Texans -2.5 at Indianapolis Colts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pittsburgh Steelers at Atlanta Falcons -3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Carolina Panthers at New Orleans Saints -4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minnesota Vikings -1.5 at New York Giants</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tennessee Titans at Chicago Bears -4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New England Patriots at Cincinnati Bengals -8.5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jacksonville Jaguars at Miami Dolphins -3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Denver Broncos at Seattle Seahawks -6</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Las Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles Chargers -3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dallas Cowboys at Cleveland Browns -2.5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Washington Commanders at Tampa Bay Buccaneers -3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Los Angeles Rams at Detroit Lions -3.5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New York Jets at San Francisco 49ers -4.5</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick look at the betting odds shows that sportsbooks are putting a lot of love on the home teams, with only two away teams favored for the first week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFL fans and sports bettors might do well to remember the past two seasons when looking at the bias for home teams. In the 2023 season, 10 away teams won in the opening week with only six home teams securing the early win. In the 2022 season, 9 away teams won, with six home teams winning and one tie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At DraftKings, some of the top favorites for bettors are the away Texans -2.5 with 73% of bets according to sports betting writer <strong>Ben Fawkes.</strong> The Dolphins -3.5, Eagles -2.5, Bengals -8.5 and Cowboys +2.5 are also getting plenty of action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At BetMGM, which is a joint venture from <strong>MGM Resorts International </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MGM#NYSE\">MGM</a>) and <strong>Entain</strong>, the Texans -2.5 are also the most bet team at 78% of bets.

This report could significantly influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision on September 18. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geopolitical concerns are adding to the sector&#8217;s woes following a <strong>Nikkei</strong> report indicating that China's chip technology is advancing rapidly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/09/40689835/us-manufacturing-activity-extends-contraction-for-fifth-month-demand-continues-to\">U.S. Manufacturing Activity Extends Contraction For Fifth Month: &#8216;Demand Continues To Be Weak&#8217;</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report suggested that Chinese-made chips are now only three years behind TSMC&#8217;s, raising concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to curb China&#8217;s technological progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the tension, there are reports that China has warned of possible retaliation if Japan restricts exports of chipmaking equipment to China. This development is particularly concerning for companies like Applied Materials, which relies on international markets for a significant portion of its revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impact on Applied Materials</strong>: Applied Materials, a major player in the semiconductor equipment industry, is particularly vulnerable to these geopolitical developments.

In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages  &#8211; like <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMAT\">Applied Mat</a>&#8216;s page for example &#8211; there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are known as capital allocation programs. Applied Materials does pay a dividend, which yields 0.79% per year as of the closing price on Sep. 3, 2024. Feel free to search Benzinga's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/dividends\">dividend calendar</a> for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 13.78%, you'll need to buy a share of Saba Cap Inc &amp; Opps by the Sep. 10, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.09 on Sep. 30, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMAT\">Applied Mat</a> will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently.

The discontinuation of these products aligns with Apple's typical strategy to phase out older models to make room for new releases. The upcoming event, known as \"Glowtime,\" is anticipated to be a major showcase for Apple, highlighting new models with AI capabilities, larger screen sizes and other enhanced features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Else: </strong>In addition to product updates, Apple is indirectly involved in significant supply chain developments, particularly in Taiwan. <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSM#NYSE\">TSM</a>), a key chip supplier for Apple, is leading efforts to localize neon gas production by 2025.

In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages  &#8211; like <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CNFR\">Conifer Holdings</a>&#8216;s page for example &#8211; there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are known as capital allocation programs. Conifer Holdings does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/dividends\">dividend calendar</a> for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 13.78%, you'll need to buy a share of Saba Cap Inc &amp; Opps by the Sep. 10, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.09 on Sep. 30, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CNFR\">Conifer Holdings</a> will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently.

Lucid, while not a pure tech company, is often categorized alongside tech stocks due to its innovation-driven business model in the EV space. A significant drop in tech stocks can lead to a decline in companies like Lucid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deeper-than-expected contraction in U.S. manufacturing data and concerns about future employment challenges may also be worrying investors. A weaker economic outlook can lead to concerns about consumer demand, which would directly affect companies like Lucid that rely on strong consumer spending for their high-priced vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/09/40676774/september-market-seasonality-why-this-month-is-historically-the-toughest-for-investors\">September Market Seasonality: Why This Month Is Historically The Toughest For Investors</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Buy LCID Stock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share &#8211; or fractional share &#8211; of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Lucid Group&#8217;s case, it is in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

On Tuesday, shares are trading at $109.04, down 13.4% in three trading days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on 24.53 billion Nvidia shares outstanding, this represents a loss of $413.1 billion in Nvidia's market capitalization over the last three trading sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, that $413.1-billion drop is greater than the combined value of several of the most well-known companies worldwide:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>McDonalds Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MCD#NYSE\">MCD</a>): $204.5 billion</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disney </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DIS#NYSE\">DIS</a>): $162.1 billion</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coinbase Global</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/COIN#NASDAQ\">COIN</a>): $42.4 billion</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add the value of those three companies up and you have $409 billion, which is less than the amount of value erased from Nvidia over the last three trading days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https://bzresearch.myclickfunnels.com/benzinga-pro-content-webinar-registration/?utm_source=BZprocontent090324&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\"> Benzinga Pro chart</a> below shows the change in value for Nvidia stock over the last month. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://bzresearch.myclickfunnels.com/benzinga-pro-content-webinar-registration/?utm_source=BZprocontent090324&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"995\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03145938/Screenshot-158.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-527782\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03145938/Screenshot-158.png 995w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03145938/Screenshot-158-300x138.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03145938/Screenshot-158-768x354.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/broad-u-s-equity-etfs/24/09/40691773/exclusive-top-20-most-searched-tickers-on-benzinga-pro-in-august-2024-where-do-tesla-n\">EXCLUSIVE: Top 20 Most-Searched Tickers On Benzinga Pro In August 2024 \u2013 Where Do Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, AMD Stock Rank?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important</strong>: Nvidia shares have soared in value thanks to its impressive earnings reports, strong guidance and backlog of demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the second-quarter earnings report beat estimates, there were several less than positive takeaways: investors and analysts are now seeing the company beat estimates and grew revenue at lower rates than in past quarters. In essence, the beats are getting smaller and smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other concerns include margins and potentially lower growth rates in upcoming quarters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts were mixed in their sentiment after the earnings report, with many seeing the sell-off as a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40628887/nvidia-analysts-say-pullback-is-buying-opportunity-pushing-ai-envelope-too-signific\">potential buying opportunity</a> for long-term investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Nvidia, the rise of the stock may have been too much all at once. It was just last May that the company passed the $1-trillion market capitalization milestone for the first time. The company went on to pass the $2-trillion and $3-trillion valuation levels and for a short time this year became the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39386946/microsoft-apple-step-aside-nvidia-is-now-the-most-valuable-public-company-in-the-world\">most valuable company </a>in the world at $3.33 trillion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia is expected to report third-quarter financial results in November. The question will be whether shares can recover before then and if the next earnings report will be as hyped as the recent second-quarter report. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NVDA Price Action: </strong>Nvidia shares are trading at $109.04 versus a 52-week trading range of $39.23 to $140.76. Despite the short-term valuation loss, the stock is up 126% year-to-date in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://bzresearch.myclickfunnels.com/benzinga-pro-content-webinar-registration/?utm_source=BZprocontent090324&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"997\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03150016/Screenshot-157.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-527787\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03150016/Screenshot-157.png 997w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03150016/Screenshot-157-300x153.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03150016/Screenshot-157-768x391.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/05/39011237/exclusive-nvidia-dow-jones-inclusion-a-matter-of-when-will-it-replace-intel\">EXCLUSIVE: Nvidia Dow Jones Inclusion &#8216;A Matter Of When&#8217; \u2014 Will It Replace Intel?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&#x1f534;WATCH LIVE: Nvidia Q2 2024 Earnings Call &#x7C; $NVDA\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvKvcpZQWag?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Nvidia. </em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T20:01:33Z", "headline": "Nvidia Stock Loses The Value Of McDonald's, Disney, Coinbase Combined Since Q2 Earnings: AI Darling's Decline Continues Tuesday", "id": 40695512, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Nvidias-Hopper-Architecture-GPUs-Are-A-B.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Nvidias-Hopper-Architecture-GPUs-Are-A-B.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Nvidias-Hopper-Architecture-GPUs-Are-A-B.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Nvidia grew from a $1 trillion to $3 trillion company over the last 16 months.

Yet, these programs are optional and vary widely in their application across the state. <a href=\"https://drugpolicy.org/news/oregons-drug-recriminalization-will-cycle-people-in-and-out-of-jail-without-connection-to-care-failing-to-deliver-the-change-it-promised/\">According</a> to the <strong>Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)</strong>, only 28 of Oregon's 36 counties have sought state funding to implement such programs, and most are not yet operational. This patchwork approach has raised concerns that many individuals will be left without meaningful access to treatment, instead cycling through the criminal justice system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Measure 110 had major successes but was scapegoated by corporate interests &amp; drug war defenders. It provided over $300M for health services and increased the number of people entering voluntary treatment by 205%.<br><br>These successes can't be downplayed or attributed to H.B. 4002.</p>&mdash; Drug Policy Alliance (@DrugPolicyOrg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrugPolicyOrg/status/1830332807580701099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Advocates Condemn Revival Of Failed Policies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Advocacy groups argue that H.B. 4002 is a step backward, reviving the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/06/39470316/un-health-officials-new-report-calls-for-end-to-drug-war-harm-reduction-scientific-approach-to-d\">failed drug policies</a> that have disproportionately affected communities of color. &#8220;Make no mistake, H.B. 4002 is taken from the same drug war playbook that has failed us for decades: cycle people in and out of jails, spend more resources on law enforcement that could go towards services people need, and saddle people \u2013 especially people of color \u2013 with criminal records that act as barriers to housing, employment, benefits, and education for the rest of their lives,\" said <strong>Lindsay LaSalle</strong>, managing director of policy at the DPA. Critics also highlight the state's ongoing shortage of public defenders, which could result in many drug possession cases being dismissed without connecting individuals to any support services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Oregon's Treatment Infrastructure Lags Behind Needs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the reinstatement of criminal penalties, Oregon's treatment infrastructure remains underdeveloped, with significant gaps in services such as residential treatment and withdrawal management. For example, a deflection center was planned in Multnomah County, but its opening has been delayed, as <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/01/oregon-starts-drug-possession-recriminalization/\">detailed</a> by the OPB.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, most of Oregon's counties are either unprepared or unwilling to implement comprehensive deflection programs by the law's effective date. Meanwhile, police will arrest and possibly detain drug users until a deflection team can intervene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just after <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/content/40664168/international-overdose-awareness-day-an-important-observance\">the day meant to honor those lost to overdose</a>, Oregon's decision to recriminalize drug possession could mean going back into the controversial era that many hoped had ended. Advocates continue to call for investment in public health solutions, arguing that support services, not punishment, is the key to saving lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40667307/trumps-cannabis-endorsement-marijuana-industry-responds-we-have-two-candidates-who-are-pro-marij\"><strong>Trump&#8217;s Cannabis Endorsement &#8211; Marijuana Industry Responds: &#8216;We Have Two Candidates&#8217; Who Are Pro-Marijuana</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Featured image was generated with AI tools.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T20:19:38Z", "headline": "Oregon Recriminalizes Drugs: Critics Warn Of Widening Public Health Gaps Amid The Measure's Rollback", "id": 40695992, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/oregondrugrecriminalization.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/oregondrugrecriminalization.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/oregondrugrecriminalization.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Oregon drug recriminalization sparks controversy as advocates argue it revives failed policies and neglects public health solutions.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T20:19:39Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40695992/oregon-recriminalizes-drugs-critics-warn-of-widening-public-health-gaps-amid-the-measures-rollba"}

Economists predict a slight decrease in job vacancies from 8.18 million to 8.10 million.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thursday</strong>: At 8:15 a.m., the ADP will release private payroll data for August, with expectations for job growth to increase from July&#8217;s 122,000 to 145,000. Additionally, the weekly jobless claims report is expected to show a stable reading around 230,000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Friday</strong>: The official August jobs report will be released, with nonfarm payrolls expected to rise significantly from 114,000 in July to 160,000 in August. The unemployment rate is anticipated to dip from July&#8217;s 4.3% to 4.2% in August. Pay growth is also projected to improve. Average hourly earnings are expected to increase by 0.3% month-over-month, up from the previous 0.2% pace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5 Key ETFs To Monitor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Markets are likely to react strongly to the August jobs data. Last month, equity markets suffered a significant blow due to cooler-than-expected employment growth. There was also an unexpected surge in the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/08/40129796/job-creation-tumbles-in-july-higher-unemployment-strengthens-case-for-interest-ra\">unemployment rate in July.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similarly disappointing report for August could further elevate bets on a larger rate cut during the September FOMC meeting. Conversely, if the data shows that labor market conditions remain robust and that July&#8217;s negative trends were temporary, traders may temper their expectations for aggressive Fed rate cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to keep an eye on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TLT#NASDAQ\">TLT</a>): A rise in TLT could indicate cooler-than-expected jobs data and increasing rate cut expectations. For instance, TLT surged 3% on Aug. 2 following the July jobs report.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UUP#NYSE\">UUP</a>): This ETF, tracking the dollar&#8217;s performance against a basket of currencies, could decline in response to disappointing jobs data. On Aug. 2, UUP dropped 1%, marking its worst session of the year.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>): The U.S. stock market is highly sensitive to labor market data, as employment trends influence consumer spending, a key driver of corporate growth. SPY fell 1.9% on Aug. 2.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iShares Russell 2000 ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IWM#NYSE\">IWM</a>): Small-cap stocks are particularly vulnerable to labor market fluctuations, as a rising risk of recession could significantly impact investor sentiment toward smaller businesses. IWM plummeted 3.5% on Aug. 2.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>United States Oil Fund </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/USO#NYSE\">USO</a>): Oil prices, which are closely tied to U.S. labor market developments, may also see movement. The July jobs report&#8217;s cooler-than-expected results led to a 3.8% drop in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude futures, as tracked by the USO ETF.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40693770/wall-street-tumbles-yen-surges-oil-sinks-below-70-vix-spikes-as-traders-brace-for-volatile\">Wall Street Tumbles, Yen Surges, Oil Sinks Below $70, VIX Spikes As Traders Brace For Volatile Month</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T20:51:12Z", "headline": "Traders Bet Aggressively On Rate Cuts Ahead Of Jobs Data: 5 ETFs To Watch This Week", "id": 40696921, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/stock-traders-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/stock-traders-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/stock-traders-shutter.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Investors anticipate the release of critical labor market data between Wednesday and Friday, heightening their expectations for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.", "symbols": ["IBIT", "IWM", "SOXX", "SPY", "TLT", "USO", "UUP"], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T20:51:12Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40696921/traders-bet-aggressively-on-rate-cuts-ahead-of-jobs-data-5-etfs-to-watch-this-week"}

While not illegal, the practice has faced significant criticism for making live events inaccessible to many fans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;After the incredible news of Oasis' return, it's depressing to see vastly inflated prices excluding ordinary fans from having a chance of enjoying their favorite band live,&#8221; Nandy continued. &#8220;Working with artists, industry, and fans, we can create a fairer system that ends the scourge of touts, rip-off resales and ensures tickets at fair prices.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ticketmaster Under Scrutiny Again</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is not the first time Ticketmaster has found itself at the center of a pricing controversy.

This means that people who were arrested for possessing up to 25 grams of weed and are still in jail should be released. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/04/38023610/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-weed-legalization-in-germany-that-just-took-effect\">The law took effect on April 1<sup>st</sup></a>, but how many prisoners have been freed since then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only a few have been released, according to data requested and obtained by IPPEN.MEDIA. According to the data received for 13 out of 16 federal states, Bavaria has released the most people, with 33 prisoners freed, <a href=\"https://www.fr.de/panorama/dank-neuem-cannabis-gesetz-so-viele-haeftlinge-sind-in-deutschland-freigekommen-zr-93275311.html\">writes</a> Frankfurter Rundschau according to the translation. The second state with the most freed individuals is Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which has released 19 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the highest number of releases is likely in <strong>North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW</strong>), a state in western Germany. With more than 18 million inhabitants, NRW is the most populous state in the country. Moreover, it is said that the state's regulators have reviewed the most files, but the ministry couldn't provide the requested data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis legalization opponents often argue that legalization leads to a large number of criminals being back on the streets. The number of released prisoners under the new cannabis law in Germany testifies against this claim. This is because a significant number of people imprisoned for substance offenses have multiple convictions. They were not put in prison just because they were \"caught with a joint,\" according to one ministry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Get Benzinga's exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

The case is before the Mannheim Regional Court and involves a 36-year-old man who smuggled 450 kilograms (992.08 lbs) of cannabis into Germany, estimated to be worth 1.9 million euros ($2.1 million), reports the German outlet. The controversy arises from the new law, which doesn't consider cannabis-related crimes as serious crimes and therefore the prosecutors can't use encrypted chats from the provider Encrochat as evidence. The man was released, prompting Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg&#8217;s Minister of Justice, <strong>Marion Gentges</strong> (CDU), to say, &#8220;Drug dealers are beneficiaries of this law.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40471930/germany-sets-new-limits-for-driving-under-the-influence-of-marijuana-berlin-confirms-cannabis-cl\"><strong>Germany Sets New Limits For Driving Under The Influence Of Marijuana, Berlin Confirms Cannabis Club Oversight</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018<strong>Enormous Workload' For </strong><strong>The Judiciary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in March, justice ministers from various states joined together to push for postponing its enactment from April 1 to October arguing that the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/03/37460894/germanys-justice-ministers-want-to-postpone-cannabis-legalization-citing-thousands-of-amnesty-ex\">judicial system will be burdened</a> with thousands of cases of people seeking retroactive amnesty or expungement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In Lower Saxony alone, we anticipate over 16,000 files due to the proposed amnesty, which will need to be manually reviewed by our already overburdened staff \u2013 nationally, this figure is significantly higher,&#8221; Lower Saxony's Justice Minister <strong>Kathrin Wahlmann</strong> said at the time, <a href=\"https://cannabizeu.com/federal-states-want-a-six-month-delay-in-cannabis-legalisation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according</a> to CannaBizEu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the postponement failed, the judiciary has been flooded with files that need to be reviewed.

Some amnesty cases fall fully, some partially, under the intended amnesty, and this needs to be clarified, which requires time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The additional workload caused by the Cannabis Law is enormous for the judiciary,\" said Bavaria&#8217;s CSU Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich. In Bavaria alone, prosecutors need to manually review about 41,500 paper files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the bright side, as time passes, there will be fewer cannabis prisoners under the new law, which will reduce the judiciary's workload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue reading on <a href=\"https://www.fr.de/panorama/dank-neuem-cannabis-gesetz-so-viele-haeftlinge-sind-in-deutschland-freigekommen-zr-93275311.html\">Frankfurter Rundschau</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39830117/medical-marijuana-regulated-as-ibuprofen-is-one-of-the-biggest-breakthroughs-of-germanys-cannabi\">Medical Marijuana Regulated As Ibuprofen Is One Of The Biggest Breakthroughs Of Germany&#8217;s Cannabis Law</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/40017479/medical-marijuana-to-be-more-widely-reimbursed-in-germany-hemp-bill-attracts-investors-and-more-\"><strong>Medical Marijuana To Be More Widely Reimbursed In Germany, Hemp Bill Attracts Investors And More Cannabis News</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of Couperfield via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T21:49:00Z", "headline": "Weed Smuggler Among Few Freed Under Germany's New Cannabis Law", "id": 40697724, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Illegal-cannabis--seized-marijuana-Dried.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Illegal-cannabis--seized-marijuana-Dried.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/Illegal-cannabis--seized-marijuana-Dried.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T21:49:01Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40697724/weed-smuggler-among-few-freed-under-germanys-new-cannabis-law"}
{"author": "Juan Sp\u00ednelli", "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/psychedelics\">Psychedelics</a>, such as psilocybin, DMT, mescaline and LSD have attracted increasing attention for their potential mental health benefits. These substances elicit profound acute subjective effects, ranging from altered cognition and perception to intense emotional experiences. While <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40528986/psychedelic-trips-resemble-near-death-experiences-new-study-shows-what-does-it-mean\">mystical experiences</a> are often highlighted, a new review <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-024-00345-6\">published</a> in Nature Reviews Psychology emphasizes that the therapeutic potential of psychedelics extends far beyond these mystical states.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Therapeutic Potential And Risks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychedelics have shown promise in treating mood and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40663142/single-dose-psilocybin-therapy-shows-promise-for-treating-alcohol-use-disorder-study-finds\">substance use disorders</a>, with some studies suggesting their ability to provide profound and lasting relief. The acute subjective effects experienced during a psychedelic session\u2014such as emotional breakthroughs, heightened affect and a sense of connectedness\u2014are believed to be key drivers of these therapeutic outcomes. However, the review notes that these benefits are not universal, and psychedelics can also induce challenging psychological states, including anxiety, existential struggles and depersonalization, which sometimes necessitate therapeutic intervention, according to the authors  <strong>David B. Yaden</strong>, <strong>Sean P. Goldy</strong>, <strong>Brandon Weiss</strong> and <strong>Roland R. Griffiths</strong>,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The review underscores the importance of understanding these acute effects within a clinical context, as they may hold the key to both the benefits and risks associated with <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/psychedelic-assisted-therapies\">psychedelic therapy</a>. Importantly, while some research suggests that the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics may not require these acute subjective experiences, other studies highlight their critical role in achieving lasting positive outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Measuring Acute Subjective Effects</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The review critiques methods of measuring acute subjective effects of psychedelics, pointing out inconsistencies and limitations that hinder both research and clinical practice. Existing psychometric tools, such as the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness scale, have been widely used to assess these effects. However, the authors argue that these tools often fail to capture the full range of experiences and may not adequately predict long-term therapeutic outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To advance the field, the review calls for the development of new, more comprehensive measures that can accurately assess the diverse acute effects of psychedelics. This includes incorporating insights from psychological science and creating tools that are validated through rigorous empirical testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Implications For Future Research</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The review's findings have significant implications for the future of psychedelic research and therapy. By moving beyond a narrow focus on mystical experiences, researchers can develop a more nuanced understanding of how psychedelics affect the mind and contribute to mental health. This, in turn, can lead to the development of more effective therapeutic protocols that maximize the benefits of these substances while minimizing their risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As public and scientific interest in psychedelics continues to grow, the need for data-driven, empirically validated measures becomes ever more critical. The review offers actionable recommendations for researchers and clinicians, including best practices for measuring acute subjective effects and suggestions for developing the next generation of psychometric tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cover image made with AI</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-03T21:58:02Z", "headline": "Psychedelic Therapy Needs To Move Beyond Mystical Experiences, Say Researchers In New Study", "id": 40697820, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/1.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/1.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/1.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Explore new insights into the therapeutic potential of psychedelics beyond mystical experiences and their impact on clinical outcomes.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-03T21:58:02Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40697820/psychedelic-therapy-needs-to-move-beyond-mystical-experiences-say-researchers-in-new-study"}

Last week, the newly-elected Dutch prime minister was expected to block Chinese companies <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/asia/24/08/40638552/asmls-china-business-in-crosshairs-of-dutch-government-semiconductors-at-center-of-east-west-tension\">from receiving maintenance on chipmaking machines</a> made by ASML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands-based company has already been banned from selling its most advanced machines to Chinese companies, following pressure from the U.S. on European and Asian manufacturers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, an analysis found that China's <strong>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40671027/tsmc-tech-only-3-years-ahead-of-chinas-progress-shows-analysis-us-export-restrictions-have-minimal-i\">only three years away from producing the most advanced chips</a> for smartphones, currently made by <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

The news took Taiwan Semiconductor shares down over 5% on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China's $25 billion spending on chipmaking tools puts it on track to another record year, Nikkei Asia <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-buys-more-chip-tools-than-South-Korea-Taiwan-U.S.-combined2\">reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country is also the biggest investor building semiconductor factories or \"fabs.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEMI is expecting investment into semiconductor manufacturing to rise globally as countries broaden efforts to localize a larger portion of the supply chain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to high-end semiconductors is now seen as key for guaranteeing national security interests and maintaining military and technological supremacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Efforts to secure semiconductor supply chains are reaching new levels. On Tuesday, Taiwan announced <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com//node/40686890\">an initiative to tighten its access to neon gas</a>, which is used in chip manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are seeing China continue to buy all the equipment they can for their new mature-node chipmaking facilities,&#8221; said <strong>Clark Tseng</strong>, SEMI&#8217;s senior director of market intelligence. &#8220;Concerns over potential further [export control] restrictions also pushed them to pull in and secure more equipment they could buy in advance.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investments go beyond the country's top chip companies. There are at least more than 10 tier-two chipmakers that are also \"aggressively buying new tools,\" said Tseng.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is taking China to top other countries in spending growth as well. While the U.S., Taiwan and South Korea have slowed  their spending on chipmaking tools in the first half of the year when compared to the same period of 2023, China continues to beat its own records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese state is also way ahead of the U.S. in terms of public investment and subsidies for the sector, with investments <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/asia/24/05/38800273/chinas-semiconductor-spending-tops-us-with-142b-commitment-global-chip-race-heats-up\">several times the funding given the Biden administration so far</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com//node/40684198\"><strong>Marvell Steals The Spotlight From Nvidia, Broadcom In August: What&#8217;s Next For Chip Investors?</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is China Slipping Away From Chipmakers' Hands?</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The global trend to strengthen domestic chip production could hurt companies that rely too much on China sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country continues to be a major buyer for semiconductor companies, in spite of sanctions placed in recent years.

While cannabis is widely known for its psychoactive effects due to higher THC content, hemp has traditionally been used for non-intoxicating purposes such as producing textiles and creating CBD products. However, the emergence of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39690898/no-more-getting-high-on-hemp-in-america-multiple-states-begin-intoxicating-hemp-crackdown\">intoxicating hemp-derived products </a>has blurred these lines, creating a new industry with its own interests and dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, many California cannabis companies have been <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40465710/why-are-so-many-california-cannabis-companies-switching-to-hemp-products\">switching to hemp products </a>due to the suffocating regulatory pressures and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/05/32277400/cannabis-industry-paid-1-8b-in-excess-taxes-in-2022-refund-checks-anyone\">extra tax burden</a> related to cannabis&#8217;s Schedule I classification. Additionally, major cannabis players like Curaleaf (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CURLF#OTC\">CURLF</a>), which is a member of the USCC, recently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39820619/strategy-shift-in-the-works-are-cannabis-giants-getting-into-the-hemp-derived-thc-market\">launched a hemp store</a>. Other mayor cannabis companies are evaluating whether or not to do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>USCC On Hemp Regulation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We're talking about the same THC in these hemp-derived products as in medical and adult-use cannabis. It just makes sense to regulate them in a similar manner,\" Culver said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USCC proposes to do this by making changes to the Farm Bill, which addresses the regulatory gap between hemp and cannabis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email shared in April 2024, the USCC suggested a new definition for hemp that would exclude products with detectable levels of THC intended for consumption. \"Hemp-based intoxicating products should be regulated with safety and effect on individuals in mind,\" reads the statement. This proposal aims to clarify the legal distinctions between intoxicating and non-intoxicating hemp products, much like the difference between grape juice and wine in alcohol regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But political issues for the farm bill have become complicated, and although <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/11/35822504/house-extends-2018-farm-bill-usda-tells-food-safety-workers-to-avoid-cbd-thc-products-more\">it should have been discussed on 2023</a>, even 2024 will not probably see any changes to the legislation. Culver concludes from this situation that &#8220;the conversation at the state level is really where the bulk of the action has been. And I think we&#8217;re going to see a significant amount of activity in the States on this topic in 2025.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Get Benzinga&#8217;s exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

Recently, the governor received <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39760907/ron-desantis-floridas-gop-and-hemp-industry-pile-on-to-defeat-marijuana-legalization\">financial support from hemp manufacturers</a> who are profiting from an unregulated environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"If you&#8217;re opposed to the adult-use market, which provides a heavily regulated system<strong>,</strong> why would you not want that for products with the same intoxicant?\" asked Culver rhetorically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This contradiction seems to be on everyone&#8217;s mind, even former president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who recently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40666944/donald-trump-supports-cannabis-legalization-in-florida-game-changer-and-huge-blow-to-ron-desanti\">endorsed Florida&#8217;s cannabis legalization amendment</a>, in a huge blow to De Santis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this interview took place before the Trump endorsement, Culver anticipated Trump&#8217;s move as adding promising perspectives for the cannabis industry in Florida. \"This could be a pivotal moment in getting the ballot initiative over the 60% threshold.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that at a federal level, \"It would set the stage for us to have two presidential candidates,<strong> </strong>both of whom have had their own separate journeys on cannabis reform.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40465710/why-are-so-many-california-cannabis-companies-switching-to-hemp-products\">Why Are So Many California Cannabis Companies Switching To Hemp Products?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>USCC Adds Hemp Industry Players </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although traditionally focused on cannabis, the USCC has recently been adding hemp manufacturers to the council&#8217;s lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We have had several companies from the hemp space apply for membership recently,\" Culver shared. The council aims to collaborate with all stakeholders to find common ground as they prepare for potential changes to the Farm Bill in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This anticipates a possible shift in both the hemp and cannabis space in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We're making good progress and anticipate more states will reassess or tackle hemp regulations by then,\" he added. \"We really want to make sure that USCC collaborates with all stakeholders to create a safe and fair regulatory system.\" And, he added, the USCC seeks to help create<strong> </strong>&#8220;the lowest common denominator that creates a safe and fair regulatory system.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39820619/strategy-shift-in-the-works-are-cannabis-giants-getting-into-the-hemp-derived-thc-market\">Strategy Shift In The Works? Are Cannabis Giants Getting Into The Hemp Derived-THC Market?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cannabis <strong>Rescheduling Delay</strong> May Not Be Such Bad News</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the DEA&#8217;s recent decision to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40567326/dea-delays-cannabis-rescheduling-decision-until-after-november-presidential-election\">delay cannabis rescheduling</a> until after the upcoming presidential election has sparked a curious reaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"My first reaction was one of disappointment because this is a significant delay,\" Culver said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he later reflected, \"Moving the hearing to December 2nd shows they're not using this politically.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis is a very sensitive topic. If rescheduling came before the election, it could spark doubts about the fundamentals of the decision. But other questions are raised now that the decision will be taken under a newly-elected administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The big question in my mind is<strong> </strong>can they still issue the final rule before the end of the Biden administration?\" Culver pondered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If it is a Harris administration, we would expect her to continue the process and to get to final rule at some point early in her first, term. If it&#8217;s a Trump administration, then the question becomes, what does he do, if anything?&#8221; said Culver. &#8220;And if it&#8217;s not the final rule before he takes office, if he wins, he could shelve this, rule indefinitely at the DEA, if that&#8217;s his wish. Or, of course, he could let it continue on and let the DEA decide to do as it chooses.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Culver&#8217;s comments show&#8230;in the cannabis space there&#8217;s always room for a bit of speculation and much-needed flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/07/39975361/hemp-derived-cannabinoids-vs-legal-cannabis-what-industry-members-are-saying-about-this-not-so-s\">Hemp-Derived Cannabinoids Vs.

{"author": "Juan Sp\u00ednelli", "content": "<p>In a dimly lit basement painted in deep forest green, <strong>Benji \"Dez\" Dezaval</strong> leads a small group in a discussion about community and pride. At first glance, it could be mistaken for a typical group therapy session. But as the clock nears 6 p.m., the unique nature of this gathering becomes clear. Attendees prepare to receive a \"communal gift\" \u2013 a choice of 2 grams of dried <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/magic-mushrooms\">psilocybin mushrooms</a>, a set of seven microdoses or a 10mg dose of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/dmt\">DMT</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is \"Colorado's Psychedelic Church,\" a place where spirituality, community and psychedelics intersect. As The Colorado Sun <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2024/09/03/psychedelic-church-magic-mushrooms-colorado-springs/\">reported</a>, Dezaval, who goes by Teopixqui Dez, meaning \"guard of God\" in Aztec, founded the church after a transformative experience with psilocybin mushrooms led him to believe that he was called to help others heal through these substances. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The church operates under the provisions of Colorado's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/11/29628347/colorado-joins-oregon-will-decriminalize-and-regulate-psychedelics-begin-expungement-process\">Proposition 122</a>, passed in 2022, which decriminalized the use of psilocybin for adults over 21. While the state's laws allow for the sharing of psychedelics in contexts of counseling, spiritual guidance and community-based use, the concept of a \"psychedelic church\" is still a novel idea, pushing the boundaries of what these laws can accommodate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among other natural wonders, Colorado Springs &#8211; population 491,441- is known for being the base of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Safe Space For Exploration</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The church provides a safe and educational environment for those interested in exploring psychedelics. Dezaval, a former mental health worker, emphasizes that everything offered is free, describing it as an \"act of wellness.\" He carefully screens attendees to ensure they are of legal age and then provides them with safety information, including a dosing guide and warnings about potential interactions with antidepressants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Everything is provided for free as an act of wellness,\" says Dezaval, highlighting his commitment to making these experiences accessible while ensuring they are approached with respect and caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The church has become a hub for a diverse community, drawing people from various backgrounds, including veterans like Reyes Saucedo, who credits psychedelics with helping him overcome suicidal thoughts and gain a new perspective on life. Saucedo, now inspired to start his own nonprofit for veterans, praises the growing openness to the idea of discussing the therapeutic potential of psychedelics within organizations like the Veterans Administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Navigating New Legal And Social Terrain</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As Colorado's psilocybin industry <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40445352/colorados-psilocybin-industry-takes-off-new-rules-for-magic-mushroom-businesses\">begins to take shape</a>, the state is implementing regulations that cover everything from waste disposal to product labeling. These new rules are part of a broader effort to ensure the safety of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/psychedelic-assisted-therapies\">psychedelic-assisted therapies</a>, which are set to become more widely available in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Colorado Springs, where the sale of recreational marijuana is still prohibited, the city's leadership is cautiously observing the development of psychedelic initiatives like Dezaval's church. The mayor's office has acknowledged the church's existence but has not yet taken a formal stance, choosing instead to monitor the state's evolving guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Erasing The Stigma Around Psychedelics</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For many, the church represents more than just a place to access psychedelics. It is also a sanctuary where people can connect, learn and break down the stigma surrounding these substances. Attendees like Livia Demopoulous and Tori Honour, who have used psilocybin to manage depression and ADHD, see the church as an inclusive space that fosters community among those who might otherwise feel marginalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"He's very educational, which we love. We're very big on education and people understanding what they are getting,\" Honour told The Colorado Sun, reflecting the church's emphasis on informed and responsible use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The church's appeal lies in its ability to create a \"third space\" \u2013 a community hub where people can gather outside of home, work or school. It's a place where individuals, many of whom identify as LGBTQ+ or neurodivergent, can find support, connection and, if they choose, the opportunity to explore the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Chapter In Psychedelic Use</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As Colorado's first psychedelic church, Dezaval's initiative marks a significant shift in how psychedelics are perceived and utilized in the state. While the journey is just beginning, the church's focus on community, education and safe practice could pave the way for new models of healing and spiritual exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I have dedicated myself entirely to this \u2014 this is my full-time job,\" says Dezaval, who adds that he&#8217;s optimistic about the future of his church despite the financial challenges. \"This might be me being a little idealistic \u2014 I know that what we're doing is good. I'll find the money, I'll find it somehow.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cover image made with AI</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-04T01:27:27Z", "headline": "Psychedelic Church Opens In Colorado Springs, CO Making History", "id": 40699295, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/2.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/2.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/03/2.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Meet Colorado&#39;s first psychedelic church in Colorado Springs, where magic mushrooms and DMT are used for healing and creating community.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-04T01:27:27Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/40699295/psychedelic-church-opens-in-colorado-springs-co-making-history"}

However, the prosecution couldn&#8217;t prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, leading to its dismissal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robertson's attorney highlighted issues with the search warrant and noted that the plants had not yet flowered. This means that they did not contain any THC. Robertson, <strong>who stepped down as mayor amid the charges</strong>, expressed relief that the ordeal is over.

The average price was $79.70 per ounce, according to the Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency. Despite the price drop, the state saw its second-largest sales month since adult-use legalization. Sales added up to $286.4 million, <a href=\"https://www.crainsdetroit.com/cannabis/michigan-marijuana-prices-hit-record-low-july\">reported</a> Crain&#8217;s Detroit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factors contributing to the price decline include oversupply, price compression due to upcoming &#8220;Croptober&#8221; harvests and competition with illicit market products.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> is set to unveil a major tax deduction initiative aimed at new small businesses, ahead of the 2024 election, marking a significant policy move in her campaign as she looks to take on former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on the economic policies front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Harris plans to introduce a tax deduction of up to $50,000, a substantial increase from the current $5,000, aiming to support middle-class Americans. This proposal is part of her broader economic strategy as the Democratic presidential nominee, Reuters reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement will take place in New Hampshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris&#8217; campaign official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, according to the report, stated that the average cost to start a new business is around $40,000. The proposal also includes a standardized tax deduction for small businesses and measures to simplify obtaining occupational licenses nationwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the plan features a small business expansion fund to help community banks cover interest costs. The United States has approximately 33 million small businesses, employing about 46% of private sector workers and contributing to 70% of net new jobs since 2019, according to the Small Business Administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris&#8217; economic agenda, which also includes increased federal funding for childcare and other social programs, may face opposition from corporations and Congress. Similar proposals from President<strong> Joe Biden</strong> have previously been rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40678841/kamala-harriss-democrat-supporters-are-in-complete-denial-of-unrealized-capital-gains-tax-claims-pie?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kamala Harris&#8217;s Democrat Supporters Are In &#8216;Complete Denial&#8217; Of Unrealized Capital Gains Tax, Claims Pierre Ferragu, Warns &#8216;Dems Have Become The Bad Guys&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During her first major economic speech last month, Harris committed to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40467624/harris-price-gouging-plan-faces-pushback-from-grocers-hurting-from-the-same-inflationary-pressure-as\">tax cuts for most Americans</a>, banning &#8220;price gouging&#8221; by grocers, and increasing affordable housing. She aims for 25 million small business applications in her first term, surpassing the 19 million under Biden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republican advisers <strong>Kevin Hassett</strong> and <strong>Stephen Moore </strong>argue that Harris&#8217; proposals could increase inflation and harm the economy. Harris and Trump will debate on Sept. 10, with a focus on economic issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris&#8217; official campaign team did not immediately respond to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pro.benzinga.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga</a>'s request for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Harris&#8217;s new tax deduction proposal is part of a broader economic strategy that has been unfolding over the past few months. In her recent ad campaign, Harris took a direct shot at <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40687930/kamala-harriss-new-ad-campaign-focused-takes-a-dig-at-trumps-economic-policies\">Trump&#8217;s economic policies</a>, highlighting her commitment to middle-class Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Harris&#8217;s tax plan <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40650939/kamala-harris-wants-to-tax-the-ultra-wealthy-with-unrealized-gains-tax-leaving-silicon-valley-unsett\">targeting the ultra-wealthy</a> has caused a stir in Silicon Valley, indicating her broader strategy to address income inequality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her housing plan, which <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/real-estate/24/08/40666669/tax-incentives-and-federal-land-kamala-harris-housing-plan-under-the-microscope-as-real-estate-exper\">includes tax incentives</a> and the use of federal land, has also been under scrutiny, with real estate experts analyzing its potential impact on the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Harris&#8217;s proposal to end taxation on income from tips, which she announced at a Las Vegas rally, mirrors a similar idea floated by Trump this year.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p> <strong>JPMorgan</strong> has issued a cautionary note suggesting that these <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40541128/fed-chair-powells-signal-sets-stage-for-rate-global-central-banks-hint-at-interest-rate-cuts-in-revi\">cuts may not significantly benefit the stock market</a>, ahead of the anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: JPMorgan has cautioned that anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts may not significantly propel stock markets. The firm suggests that the cuts will be reactive to slowing economic growth, potentially dampening their positive impact on equities, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-interestrate-cuts-stock-market-bull-run-upside-outlook-jpmorgan-2024-9?utm_campaign=markets-sf&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">reported</a> Business Insider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent research note, JPMorgan strategists, led by <strong>Mislav Matejka</strong>, stated that the Fed&#8217;s rate cuts might not be sufficient to drive a new surge in the stock market. &#8220;Fed will start easing, but more in a reactive way and as a response to weakening growth \u2014 this might not be enough to drive a next leg higher,&#8221; they wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm&#8217;s perspective contrasts with more optimistic forecasts from other analysts. For example, a <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> analyst recently predicted a significant equity rally once the Fed eases its policy. Similarly, veteran strategist <strong>Jim Paulson</strong> suggested that the Fed&#8217;s pivot could usher in a &#8220;brand new bull market.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fed Chairman <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> signaled last month at the Jackson Hole Symposium that <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40541128/fed-chair-powells-signal-sets-stage-for-rate-global-central-banks-hint-at-interest-rate-cuts-in-revi\">interest rate cuts are likely</a>. The next major indicator for the Fed will be Friday&#8217;s nonfarm payrolls report, influencing the expected 25 basis point rate cut at the late-September policy meeting, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40680914/nvidia-takes-a-page-from-apples-playbook-jensen-huang-wants-ai-stalwart-to-go-beyond-chips-and-b?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia Takes A Page From Apple&#8217;s Playbook: Jensen Huang Wants AI Stalwart To Go Beyond Chips And Be One-Stop Shop For Data Center Clients</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The potential impact of Fed rate cuts has been a topic of significant debate among economists and market analysts. In late August, economists noted that inflation was &#8220;becoming boring again&#8221; as numbers aligned with targets, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/08/40654794/inflation-is-becoming-boring-again-as-numbers-are-right-on-target-economists\">suggesting a resilient economy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, earlier in the month, some experts <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40303909/economist-pours-cold-water-on-september-rate-cut-we-need-to-see-some-sustained-weakness\">poured cold water on the idea of a September rate cut</a>, arguing that sustained economic weakness was necessary before any cuts could be justified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the complexity, <strong>Garry Evans</strong>, chief strategist of global asset allocation at <strong>BCA Research </strong>warned of an impending U.S. recession, suggesting that r<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40523087/a-looming-recession-top-analyst-believes-rate-cuts-cant-save-the-day-every-single-one-of-us-now-beli\">ate cuts might not be enough</a> to stave off economic downturn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/09/40675100/federal-reserve-may-be-prompted-to-pause-rate-cuts-in-reponse-to-supply-side-shocks\">potential supply-side shocks</a> could prompt the Federal Reserve to pause its rate cuts, according to <strong>Brian Jacobsen</strong>, Chief Economist at\u00a0<strong>Annex Wealth Management</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/40685346/if-you-invested-1000-in-bitcoin-when-eminem-mentioned-the-crypto-in-best-selling-album-kam?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">If You Invested $1000 In Bitcoin When Eminem Mentioned The Crypto In Best-Selling Album &#8216;Kamikaze&#8217;, Here&#8217;s How Much You&#8217;d Have Today</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image generated with AI via Midjourney</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Kaustubh-Bagalkote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kaustubh Bagalkote</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-04T05:37:01Z", "headline": "JPMorgan Warns Anticipated Rate Cuts May Not Significantly Boost Stock Markets: 'Fed Will Start Easing, But More In A Reactive Way'", "id": 40700320, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/04/fed-ai5.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/04/fed-ai5.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/04/fed-ai5.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "JPMorgan has issued a cautionary note suggesting that these cuts may not significantly benefit the stock market, ahead of the anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-04T05:37:01Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/09/40700320/jpmorgan-warns-anticipated-rate-cuts-may-not-significantly-boost-stock-markets-fed-will-start-ea"}

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>Billionaire entrepreneurs <strong>Mark Cuban</strong> and <strong>Elon Musk </strong>found themselves at odds over a controversial interview conducted by former Fox News host <strong>Tucker Carlson</strong>. The interview, which focused on World War II and <strong>Winston Churchill</strong>, sparked a strong reaction from Cuban after Musk endorsed it as &#8220;worth watching.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The spark of controversy ignited when Musk, the CEO of <strong>Tesla Inc.</strong> and <strong>SpaceX</strong>, took to X (formerly Twitter) to endorse an interview featuring Carlson and<strong> Darryl Cooper</strong>, host of The MartyrMade Podcast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk wrote, &#8220;Very interesting. Worth watching,&#8221; drawing attention to the interview. Carlson had introduced Cooper as possibly &#8220;the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,&#8221; noting that Cooper&#8217;s latest project delves into what Carlson termed &#8220;the most forbidden of all: trying to understand World War Two.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuban, entrepreneur and part-owner of the <strong>Dallas Mavericks</strong>, <a href=\"https://x.com/mcuban/status/1831175599706030588\">responded</a> to Musk&#8217;s endorsement with a simple yet pointed message: &#8220;Delete your account.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Delete your account <a href=\"https://t.co/DKOWv72ly0\">https://t.co/DKOWv72ly0</a></p>&mdash; Mark Cuban (@mcuban) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1831175599706030588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview between Carlson and Cooper covered a wide range of controversial topics. They discussed the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict and delved into World War II, including an assessment of former U.K. Prime Minister Churchill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touched on how history is rewritten and propagandized, a topic that often generates intense debate in academic and political circles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Carlson and Cooper explored contemporary issues such as mass immigration in Europe and the Civil Rights Movement, drawing parallels to the Black Lives Matter movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also shared their views on several prominent political figures, including Hungarian Prime Minister<strong> Viktor Orban</strong>, Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, and former U.S. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/24/09/40686893/elon-musk-is-so-rich-that-if-you-printed-1m-a-day-since-the-renaissance-you-still-wouldnt-catch?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elon Musk Is So Rich That If You Printed $1M a Day Since The Renaissance, You Still Wouldn&#8217;t Catch Up</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: In August, Musk sent Carlson a Tesla Cybertruck to review, which Carlson used for stunts, including <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/08/40207366/elon-musk-sends-tucker-carlson-a-cybertruck-to-review-newscaster-does-donuts-shoots-at-vehi\">shooting at the vehicle</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tension between Cuban and Musk is not new.

This incident further fueled the ongoing friction between the two billionaires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Musk&#8217;s response to Cuban&#8217;s poll debacle, where he commented on the &#8220;tenacity of his stupidity,&#8221; added another layer to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/09/40670029/elon-musk-marvels-at-the-tenacity-of-his-stupidity-after-mark-cubans-poll-debacle-it-is-a-marvel-to\">their public feud</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the criticism, Cuban continues to post on X, stating he values the platform for its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40679223/mark-cuban-explains-why-despite-getting-a-lot-of-flak-from-elon-musk-and-others-he-continues-to-post\">diversity of opinions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40682383/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-doubts-volkswagens-proposed-5b-rivian-investment-amid-reports-that-it-is-conside?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tesla CEO Elon Musk Doubts Volkswagen&#8217;s Proposed $5B Rivian Investment Amid Reports That It Is Considering Closing Its Factories In Germany: &#8216;Where Will They Get The Money?&#8217;</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image Via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Kaustubh-Bagalkote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kaustubh Bagalkote</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-09-04T06:15:10Z", "headline": "Mark Cuban Tells Elon Musk 'Delete Your Account' After Tech Billionaire Calls Tucker Carlson's Latest Episode On WW2 And Churchill 'Worth Watching'", "id": 40700524, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/09/04/musk-cuban-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/09/04/musk-cuban-shutter.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/09/04/musk-cuban-shutter.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "The interview, which focused on World War II and Winston Churchill, sparked a heated debate between the two high-profile figures.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-09-04T06:15:11Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40700524/mark-cuban-tells-elon-musk-delete-your-account-after-tech-billionaire-calls-tucker-carlsons-latest-e"}

The package includes 4 units each of wheels, specialized tires, and tire pressure sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, Cybertruck lead engineer&nbsp;<strong>Wes Morrill</strong> gave his recommendations for tires on the Cybertruck and said that all-terrain tires are typically better than all-season tires in snow.

This year, the company will have more Cybertruck vehicles and drivers on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is currently ramping up Cybertruck production, aiming to deliver 250,000 units starting in 2025.
