The company&#8217;s technology aims to improve the onset and efficacy of existing ADHD treatments. Zacks Small-Cap Research\u00a0also issued a note with a $70 valuation on the stock earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trading Volume:</strong> The stock opened at $6.63 and has traded within a day range of $6.01 to $9.69. The 50-day moving average stands at $5.81. Cingulate&#8217;s short interest has decreased by 75.73% since its last report, now at 51,000 shares, which is 3.18% of its float. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Metrics Recap:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Market Cap (Previous Close):</strong> $11.12 million</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>52-Week Range:</strong> $1.80 &#8211; $187.2</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Float:</strong> 1.622 million shares</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Institutional Ownership:</strong> 1.13%</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insider Ownership:</strong> 14.27%</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Buy CING Stock?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-stock-trading-platforms\">possible trading platforms here.</a> Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, or Amazon.com, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the the case of Cingulate (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CING#NASDAQ\">CING</a>), which is trading at $8.2 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 12.2 shares of stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CING Price Action:</strong> Cingulate shares were up by 15% at $7.42 according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard?new_user=False&amp;backend=google-oauth2\">Benzinga pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/?utm_source=BZprocontent083024&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"995\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/30135852/CING-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-523887\" style=\"width:482px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/30135852/CING-2.png 995w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/30135852/CING-2-300x155.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/30135852/CING-2-768x397.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40655737/wall-street-analysts-believe-xpel-could-rally-49-46-heres-is-how-to-trade\">Wall Street Analysts Believe XPEL Could Rally 49.46%: Here&#8217;s is How to Trade</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-30T19:23:25Z", "headline": "What's Going On With Cingulate Shares Recently?", "id": 40660597, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Invest-In-Blue-Chip-Stocks.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Invest-In-Blue-Chip-Stocks.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/30/Invest-In-Blue-Chip-Stocks.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Cingulate Inc.
