This tool is part of a broader effort to grow New York's recreational marijuana industry in a way that supports the state's ambitious green energy mandates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After PowerScore comes online, licensed cultivators will have to submit an annual report and sustainability plan to OCM. The deadline for submissions is August 31, 2025, <a href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2024/08/20/ny-cannabis-growers-have-1-year-to-submit-sustainability-plan\">reported</a> Spectrum News.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is PowerScore?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PowerScore is a benchmarking and reporting platform specified by the OCM as the approved tool for resource tracking.

{"author": "Juan Sp\u00ednelli", "content": "<p>Although LSD is best known for its hallucinogenic effects, a recent research <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(24)10432-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS240584402410432X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">published</a> in Heliyon is sparking interest in its potential <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/psychedelic-assisted-therapies\">therapeutic applications</a>. This study explores how LSD could influence the way the brain processes pain, breaking new ground for research in cognitive science and pharmacology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Insights Into Pain Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As PsyPost <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/lsd-reshapes-the-brains-response-to-pain-neuroimaging-study-finds/#google_vignette\">reported</a>, the study, conducted by a team led by <strong>Hamid Sharini</strong> of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, aimed to uncover the mechanisms by which <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/lsd\">LSD</a>, a synthetic chemical, made from a substance found in a fungus that infects rye grains, influences the brain&#8217;s pain processing networks. This network includes key brain regions involved in the perception, processing, and response to pain. Sharini emphasized the significance of this research. \"Investigating how LSD alters pain perception could provide insights into the drug's mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications. This, in turn, could lead to the development of new, potentially more effective pain management strategies.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Closer Look At The Study</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The study involved 20 adult participants, all carefully selected to guarantee that they had no history of psychiatric illness, substance abuse or major medical conditions. In addition, none of the participants had prior experience with psychedelic drugs, ensuring that the observed effects could be attributed solely to LSD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each participant underwent two sessions, with at least two weeks between sessions to allow the effects of the drug to dissipate. In one session, they were administered a placebo, and in the other, a controlled dose of LSD. The double-blind design ensured that participants were unaware of which session involved LSD, minimizing the risk of expectation bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To monitor the brain&#8217;s response, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during both sessions. This imaging technique measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow, capturing the peak effects of LSD at specific times after administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Findings: LSD Alters Pain-Related Brain Activity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The results revealed significant differences in how the brain processed pain under the influence of LSD compared to the placebo. Analysis of brain activity, specifically through amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), showed reduced activity in regions typically associated with pain processing, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the thalamus, during the LSD session. This reduction in activity suggests that LSD may decrease the brain&#8217;s focus on pain, aligning with anecdotal reports of reduced pain perception under the influence of psychedelics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further analysis using independent component analysis (ICA) uncovered changes in connectivity patterns between different brain regions. Specifically, LSD appeared to disrupt the typical connectivity between areas involved in the emotional and cognitive aspects of pain, while enhancing connectivity in regions associated with attention and decision-making, such as the frontal pole. These changes could explain how LSD alters the subjective experience of pain, potentially by redirecting attention away from the discomfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the study noted increased activity in the insula, a region of the brain involved in perceiving bodily states and emotions. This heightened activity suggests that LSD might enhance awareness of internal sensations while altering how these sensations are interpreted, which could contribute to the perception of pain as being less severe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding The Scope And Limits Of The Study</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While these findings are promising, the researchers are cautious about drawing broad conclusions. &#8220;LSD affects pain-related brain networks in ways that were not anticipated, potentially leading to new insights into pain mechanisms,\" Sharini explained to <em>PsyPost</em>. However, he also emphasized the need for further studies, noting, \"More studies are needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks. Caution is necessary: LSD is a powerful substance, and its use outside of a controlled research setting is not recommended.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, this study was conducted with healthy volunteers who were not experiencing chronic pain, leaving unanswered questions about how LSD might affect individuals with chronic pain conditions. These individuals may have different brain connectivity patterns, which could influence how they respond to LSD. Further research is needed to explore whether LSD could be effective in managing chronic pain in patients and how it compares to other pain management strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study focused on the acute effects of LSD, measuring brain activity and connectivity during the immediate aftermath of drug administration. As Sharini pointed out, \"While the short-term effects of LSD have been extensively studied, our understanding of its long-term implications for the brain and pain experience remains limited.\" The research team plans to explore these long-term effects in future studies.</p>", "created_at": "2024-08-21T21:35:46Z", "headline": "LSD's Potential In Pain Management: New Research Sheds Light On Psychedelic's Influence On Brain Networks", "id": 40496220, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/21/2-9.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/21/2-9.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/21/2-9.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "New research reveals how LSD alters brain networks involved in pain processing, offering potential insights for future pain management strategies.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-21T21:35:46Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40496220/lsds-potential-in-pain-management-new-research-sheds-light-on-psychedelics-influence-on-brain-ne"}

A decade ago, the golf courses and resorts were a financial burden on the Trump Organization, which primarily profited from real estate. However, the tables have turned with the golf and resort business now accounting for about 80% of the company&#8217;s cash flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump Organization, owned by Trump, is projected to generate approximately $80 million in cash after operating expenses this year, with annual revenues exceeding $600 million, according to Reuters. This is the first detailed estimate of Trump&#8217;s projected 2024 income as he vies for the presidency in November&#8217;s election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the golf business&#8217;s success, the Trump Organization faces over $530 million in court judgments and interest against Trump, his family members in senior roles, and his companies. The organization is also grappling with a weak commercial real estate market in New York and the uncertainty of the presidential race outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Trump</strong>, who runs the family business, responded to the reported projections, stating, &#8220;The Trump Organization is the strongest it has ever been.&#8221; However, he did not comment directly on the financial estimates or other specifics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s wealth is largely tied up in his majority stake in <strong>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DJT#NASDAQ\">DJT</a>), owner of social media platform Truth Social. Despite a significant drop in stock value, the company still has a market capitalization of about $4.5 billion, with Trump&#8217;s stake worth approximately $2.5 billion as of Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crown jewel of Trump&#8217;s business is the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, which is estimated to generate $24 million in cash in 2024. Three nearby golf-focused properties are also thriving, with revenue increasing post-Covid. The rise in golf-related cash flow underscores Trump&#8217;s popularity among affluent Americans, particularly in Florida, a stronghold of his Make America Great Again movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40432918/mark-cuban-slams-trumps-beat-inflation-in-100-days-plan-he-instruct-a-bunch-of-un-named-bureaucrats?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mark Cuban Slams Trump&#8217;s Beat Inflation In 100-Day Plan: &#8216;He Will Instruct A Bunch Of Un-Named Bureaucrats\u2026 Talk To All The Other Un-Named Bureaucrats&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Trump&#8217;s financial situation has been a topic of interest, especially with his bid for the presidency in the upcoming elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent reports have revealed that Trump holds between $1 million and $5 million in cryptocurrencies.

First, he noted a clear shift in the Fed's policy emphasis towards the employment component of its dual mandate. This marks a significant change in the central bank&#8217;s approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, El-Erian pointed out that this shift comes with increased confidence that the inflation target is now attainable. He attributed this to expectations that disinflationary factors currently in play are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on inflation in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, El-Erian stated that a September rate cut is &#8220;essentially a done deal.&#8221; He explained that at the end of the July meeting, the vast majority of the Federal Open Market Committee supported a rate cut based on their economic expectations. Several members even saw a plausible case for a rate cut in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Indeed, \"several\" members saw a \"plausible\" case for that July cut,&#8221; El-Erian wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My three main takeaways from the Fed minutes:<br>  There is a clear shift in the Fed's policy emphasis to the employment component of its dual mandate.<br>  This shift comes with increased \"confidence\" that the inflation target is now attainable given expectations that the\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/CD2q4IUoC0\">https://t.co/CD2q4IUoC0</a></p>&mdash; Mohamed A.

The minutes revealed that some participants had considered the \"plausible case\" for lowering rates as early as the July meeting, a sentiment echoed by Fed Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> during the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40493778/dollar-falls-as-fed-minutes-cement-september-rate-cut-bitcoin-rallies-gold-miners-jump-to-\">subsequent press conference</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mary Daly</strong>, President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, has also expressed support for a cautious approach to interest rate cuts, citing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40433267/mary-daly-of-federal-reserve-pitches-gradual-interest-rate-cuts-citing-inflation-confidence-we-are-o\">mounting confidence in inflation control</a>. Daly emphasized the need for a gradual approach to adjusting borrowing costs, suggesting that the U.S. economy is not yet in a position to warrant rapid interest rate cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The minutes from the July FOMC meeting indicate that policymakers are leaning toward making the first interest rate cut in over four years at the upcoming September meeting, driven by ongoing progress in curbing inflation. Several participants had provided a plausible case for reducing the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40492530/fed-minutes-reveal-plausible-case-for-interest-rate-cut-as-policymakers-cheer-inflation-progress\">target range by 25 basis points</a> at the July meeting or supporting such a decision based on recent progress on inflation and increases in the unemployment rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El-Erian had previously criticized the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40356500/mohamed-el-erian-argues-fed-missed-july-rate-cut-chance-cautions-against-expecting-a-200-basis-point\">for not reducing interest rates in July</a>, warning that the market's anticipation of a 200 basis point cut over a year is excessive.

A recent study has revealed a compelling link between cannabis use and lower Body Mass Index (BMI) in U.S. adults. Analyzing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2016 to 2022, the research shows that individuals who use marijuana are less likely to be obese than those who don&#8217;t. Specifically, the study found that marijuana use among obese individuals is 35% lower than among non-obese individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While further research is needed, these findings challenge some long-held assumptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Link Between BMI And Cannabis</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Conducted by Dr. <strong>Ray M. Merrill</strong> of Brigham Young University, the study observed that in states where marijuana is legalized, either medically or recreationally, cannabis use is significantly higher. This suggests that broader availability and social acceptance of cannabis may influence these trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building on this data, the study reveals that marijuana use is 35% less prevalent among obese individuals compared to their non-obese counterparts. This trend is consistent across various demographic factors, employment statuses, smoking histories, marijuana legalization statuses and specific medical conditions like asthma, arthritis and depression. These findings carry weight due to their consistency across multiple variables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key takeaway from this extensive analysis is that &#8220;as legalization and prevalence of the drug in the U.S. increases, the prevalence of obesity may decline.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><strong><em>Get Benzinga&#8217;s exclusive analysis and the top news about the cannabis industry and markets daily in your inbox for free.

In fact, in 2022 a different group of scientists concluded that &#8220;marijuana&#8217;s introduction did not lead to increased obesity rates and may have led to decreases in obesity.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new findings come at a critical time when the United States is facing a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/03/37413349/ozempic-wegovy-other-weight-loss-drugs-wont-solve-global-obesity-crisis-affecting-1b-people-who-warn\">severe obesity epidemic</a> that&#8217;s only getting worse.

Alarming statistics show that 19 states now report obesity rates exceeding 35%\u2014a dramatic rise from a decade ago. Obesity is a significant risk factor for chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. It also imposes a massive financial burden on the healthcare system, with costs exceeding $170 billion annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous research had already proposed a link between <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/23/11/35711227/cannabis-and-its-derivatives-a-potential-tool-for-obesity-management\">cannabis use and weight reduction</a>.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against a lithium drilling project in Arizona. The project, which is being challenged by the Hualapai Tribe, has been put on hold due to its potential threat to sacred lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the drilling project, which is being carried out by an Australian mining company in the <strong>Big Sandy River Basin</strong>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lithium-mine-arizona-tribe-lawsuit-sacred-lands-1d045d0bcffb14bd27c3cf7c67790e09\">reported</a> the Associated Press on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hualapai Tribe, represented by the environmental group <strong>Earthjustice</strong> and the Western Mining Action Project, has taken legal action against the federal land managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case is one of the latest legal battles between Native American tribes, environmentalists, and President <strong>Joe Biden</strong>'s administration, as green energy projects advance into culturally significant lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tribe claims that the drilling could negatively impact the Ha'Kamwe' springs, a site of cultural and religious significance. The federal judge, <strong>Diane Humetewa</strong>, has granted a temporary restraining order, suspending the drilling until the initial arguments are heard in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hualapai Tribe alleges that the Bureau of Land Management failed to adequately assess the potential impacts on the sacred springs. They also argue that the 2002 environmental review of the land identified it as eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a traditional cultural property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arizona Lithium Ltd.</strong> (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AZLAF#OTC\">AZLAF</a>)&nbsp;plans 131 drilling sites to determine if there's sufficient lithium for a mine. The Justice Department argues that the tribe exaggerates potential harm from exploratory drilling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hualapai Tribe Chairman <strong>Duane Clarke</strong> stated, \"Today our people celebrate the granting of the temporary restraining order, but understand our fight is not over.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40453175/super-pac-founder-who-raised-hundreds-of-millions-to-back-kamala-harris-predicts-tighter-race-than-p?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Super PAC Founder, Who Raised Hundreds Of Millions To Back Kamala Harris, Predicts Tighter Race Than Public Polls Suggest: &#8216;Our Numbers Are Much Less Rosy&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The legal battle over the lithium drilling project in Arizona is part of a broader conflict between indigenous communities, environmentalists, and the Biden administration. As the demand for green energy resources, such as lithium, rises, it is increasingly encroaching on culturally significant lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global demand for lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40312619/wealth-minerals-taps-chilean-lithium-projects-to-meet-rising-global-demand\">expected to continue growing</a>. This has led to a surge in lithium prices, with industry experts predicting a potential 60% increase in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies like <strong>Volt Lithium</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/08/40287108/volt-lithium-ceo-talks-up-new-mining-extraction-method-promises-major-production-advancements\">introducing innovative extraction methods</a> to meet this growing demand sustainably.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>China&#8217;s electric vehicle industry, which has been thriving, may not be able to replicate the offshoring strategy that helped <strong>Toyota Motor Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TM#NYSE\">TM</a>) and <strong>Honda Motor Co Ltd</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HMC#NYSE\">HMC</a>) achieve global success, according to an expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: <strong>Alicia Garcia-Herrero</strong>, a senior research fellow at the Brussels-based economic think tank <strong>Bruegel</strong>, and the chief economist for Asia-Pacific at investment bank <strong>Natixis</strong> in Hong Kong, wrote an opinion <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/China-s-EV-makers-can-t-follow-Japan-s-flying-geese-offshoring-strategy\">piece</a> for Nikkei Asia on Tuesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She pointed out that the offshoring strategy that helped Japanese automakers in the 1980s might not be as effective for China&#8217;s EV industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garcia-Herrero explained that the success of China&#8217;s EV industry can be attributed to a combination of factors including industrial policy, hard work, a competitive environment, and technological transfer from foreign companies. However, she warned that the industry faces growing risks, including protectionism and a potential delay in countries&#8217; decarbonization paths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reduction of subsidies post-COVID and a sluggish economic recovery have shifted focus towards exports, as per Garcia-Herrero. In 2023, Chinese EV exports surged by 22%, compared to a 2.7% increase in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She noted that the offshoring strategy that helped Japanese automakers in the 1980s might not be as effective for China&#8217;s EV industry due to several reasons. Firstly, labor costs in Japan were much higher in the 1980s than they are now in China, which made offshoring production more attractive to Japanese automakers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, China is facing a shortage of jobs now with high youth unemployment, while Japan was in full employment with an overheated labor market. Thirdly, China&#8217;s ecosystem in terms of suppliers and trade infrastructure, coupled with many trade agreements, makes it easy for the nation to export, possibly more so than for Japan in the 1980s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, China is facing protectionism when it comes to setting up plants in other countries, which reduces the choices of the markets where it can be located.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;China would find it cheaper and more efficient to produce overseas but geopolitical reasons push against the offshoring argument.

Blue Oval is dialing back its EV optimism by about 25%, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Munster also noted that <strong>Tesla, Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) communicated a delay in the buildout of its Illinois battery production factory. The <strong>Elon Musk</strong>-led company, however, did say it remained committed to the buildout, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sizing up the two announcements, Munster said, &#8220;I believe we're in the dead of the EV winter.&#8221; He noted that growth rates of EVs have slowed from 50% in the calendar year 2023 to an estimated 5% in the calendar year 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;More importantly, many of the companies that can invest today to build EV momentum tomorrow are pulling back the reins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that the common message from these companies has been, &#8220;We're delaying, and we're still committed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notwithstanding the hiccups, Munster remained optimistic about EV adoption. &#8220;I stand by my prediction that the shift to EVs is an undeniable truth and am increasingly coming to grips that this transition will take longer than I expected,&#8221; he said. He, though, sees a change in the slope of the EV adoption curve for the next 10 years. &#8220;Time to go back to the drawing board, sharpen my pencil, and return with updated estimates,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also:<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-electric-vehicle-stocks\"> Best EV Stocks</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Important: </strong>The EV industry&#8217;s slowdown started in earnest in 2022 after the global economies emerged out of the pandemic. Incidentally, even amid the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant supply-chain disruptions, demand held up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The economic environment turned hostile after the pandemic, as the stimulus measures lavished by governments and central banks set in motion a wave of inflationary pressure. In the U.S., inflation peaked above 9% in the summer of 2022. The global central banks were left with no other option but to successively raise rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken the Fed funds rate to a 22-year high of 5.25%-5.50% in the current monetary policy cycle and has maintained it at that level till now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of higher interest rates and inflation that ate away at consumers&#8217; income rendered EV purchases unaffordable, which in turn hurt demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make matters worse, Tesla pursued aggressive price cuts, banking on its scale, and this sent the upstarts into a tailspin. On the other hand, nimble EV startups in China are giving Tesla a run for its money in the country, which is one of the latter&#8217;s key markets. Analysts and strategists say the U.S. EV giant is also stymied by a lack of an offering in the sub-$30K segment. The Tesla management&#8217;s accent appears to be on making its full self-driving software work fully unsupervised and using that as the core technology for operating its proposed robotaxi fleet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The environment has also been tough for legacy automakers, which are transitioning to EVs. Ford has substantially scaled back and slowed its EV ambitions and so has its crosstown rival <strong>General Motors Corp.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GM#NYSE\">GM</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there could be light at the end of the tunnel. Central banks, led by the Fed, are preparing to reverse their rate hikes, potentially later this year, which could improve affordability and in turn demand. In the U.S., the November election results could bring more clarity on the likely policy measures over the next four years. Republican presidential candidate <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40482862/former-tesla-exec-says-harris-not-trump-will-be-far-better-for-ev-giants-long-term-success-still-tru\">he would do away with the federal tax credit for the industry,</a> while the current Democratic regime is in favor of green-energy initiatives but has rarely acknowledged Tesla as the EV leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/KARS#NYSE\">KARS</a>) rose 2.06% to $18.81 on Wednesday, according to<em><a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\"> Benzinga Po data.</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga&#8217;s Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>following this link</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Next: </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em><a href=\"http://Tesla Shares 'Kind Of Dead In The Water' Until This Happens, Says Portfolio Manager, Blames CEO Elon Musk For Alienating Customers 'Super Important To Him'\">Tesla Shares &#8216;Kind Of Dead In The Water&#8217; Until This Happens, Says Portfolio Manager, Blames CEO Elon Musk For Alienating Customers &#8216;Super Important To Him&#8217;</a></em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T08:39:26Z", "headline": "Bad Tidings For Tesla And Its Peers?

This new low volatility environment follows a significant decline in the CBOE Volatility Index, representing the largest 9-day drop in Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge on record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubner also pointed out that professional trend followers who were shaken out of stocks during the early-August sell-off are likely to return to buy mode. He also noted that companies with authorized share buyback programs will be buying stocks over the next few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubner also mentioned that companies with authorized share buyback programs will contribute to stock purchases until a corporate blackout window begins on Sept. 13.

The Global Times, a Beijing government media outlet, stated that China has &#8220;become the best excuse&#8221; for the U.S. to maintain a large nuclear arsenal in the post-Cold War era, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/chinas-state-media-slams-us-over-biden-nuclear-strategy-report.html\">reported</a> on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Global Times editor further stated, &#8220;Instead of smearing and hyping up China, the U.S. should reflect on itself and consider how to rebuild mutual trust with China through dialogue and sincerity.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>China&#8217;s foreign ministry echoed this sentiment, accusing the U.S. of pushing &#8220;the China nuclear threat narrative, finding excuses to seek strategic advantage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman <strong>Mao Ning</strong> stated, &#8220;We have no intention to engage in any form of arms race with other countries.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This statement comes in the wake of reports that Biden&#8217;s approval of the plan, named &#8220;Nuclear Employment Guidance,&#8221; was driven by concerns from the Pentagon that China&#8217;s stockpiles will rival the &#8220;size and diversity of the United States&#8217; and Russia&#8217;s over the next decade.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/08/40462864/alibabas-e-commerce-challenges-overshadow-cloud-acceleration?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alibaba&#8217;s E-Commerce Challenges Overshadow Cloud Acceleration</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The U.S. and China have repeatedly clashed over their nuclear ambitions. The Pentagon reported last year that China&#8217;s nuclear inventory is expected to grow to more than 1,000 by 2030, and as of May 2023, China possessed over 500 operational nuclear warheads, exceeding previous projections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, China had urged the U.S. to<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39246268/china-urges-us-reconsider-nuclear-stance-following-washingtons-comments-on-increasing-warheads\"> reconsider its nuclear stance</a> following comments from a senior U.S. official about potentially increasing warheads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, China also suspended talks with the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39832267/china-halts-nuclear-talks-with-us-over-taiwan-arms-sales-after-reportedly-sanctioning-lockheed-marti\">U.S. on arms control </a>and nuclear proliferation in response to the U.S.' continued arms sales to Taiwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stephen Roach</strong>, senior fellow at Yale Law School and former chairman of<strong> Morgan Stanley Asia</strong>, warned about the increasing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39772951/morgan-stanleys-former-exec-slams-us-for-sinophobic-china-policy-never-seen-in-my-adult-lifetime-an\">vilification of China</a>, cautioning that this could lead to disastrous consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check This Out:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy: Andrew Linscott On Shutterstock.com</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Pooja-Rajkumari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pooja Rajkumari</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T09:10:32Z", "headline": "Xi Jinping's Mouthpiece Blasts Joe Biden's New Nuclear Strategy: 'Finding Excuses To Seek Strategic Advantages'", "id": 40501496, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/US-CHINA-FLAG-Photo-by-asiandelight-on-S.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/US-CHINA-FLAG-Photo-by-asiandelight-on-S.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/US-CHINA-FLAG-Photo-by-asiandelight-on-S.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "The U.S. and China have repeatedly clashed over their nuclear ambitions.", "symbols": [], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T09:15:12Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/24/08/40501496/xi-jinpings-mouthpiece-blasts-joe-bidens-new-nuclear-strategy-finding-excuses-to-seek-strategic-adva"}

{"author": "Shanthi Rexaline", "content": "<p><strong>Nvidia Corp.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) shares rebounded on Wednesday,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40493778/dollar-falls-as-fed-minutes-cement-september-rate-cut-bitcoin-rallies-gold-miners-jump-to-\"> taking the broader market higher along with it, </a>and a portfolio manager on Wednesday weighed in on the near- and medium-term outlook for the stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Ex-<strong>Google</strong> CEO <strong>Eric Schmidt</strong> recently talked up Nvidia&#8217;s stock in a video shared by Stanford University, which has since then been deleted. In the video, he was seen saying that big companies are looking to spend $20 billion, $50 billion or $100 billion on artificial intelligence data centers and the bulk of this outgo will go to Nvidia, which makes AI accelerators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Jackson, </strong>the founder and portfolio manager at EMJ Capital, said If Schmidt were right and hyper scalers were to spend $300 billion each on Nvidia over the next few years, the AI stalwart would be sold out for the next four years. The 2027 net income is estimated at $132 billion, which translates to a P/E multiple of 23 times, he noted. If the stock were to trade up to 65 times the forward P/E multiple, the company&#8217;s valuation would be $8.5 trillion and the per-share value of the stock would be $340, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The portfolio manager underlined the fact that these high-return stocks are volatile. He noted that on Aug. 5, Nvidia stock traded down to 17 times forward earnings. &#8220;These volatile names have the best returns but you have to live with the 35 &#8211; 80% drawdowns,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If Eric Schmidt is right that each hyperscaler has to spend $300B each on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NVDA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$NVDA</a> over next few years &#8211;&gt; Nvidia going to be sold out for next 4 yrs<br><br>FY&#39;27 net income = $132B<br><br>Priced at 23x now&#8230; <br><br>If they traded up to 65x forward PE = $8.5T or $340/sh &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;</p>&mdash; Eric Jackson (@ericjackson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/1826254350605602891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-artificial-intelligence-stocks\">Best AI Stocks</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Important: </strong>Nvidia has been the flagbearer of the AI revolution ever since the technology came to the forefront with the popularity of Open AI&#8217;s ChatGPT chatbot. The<strong> Jensen Huang</strong>-led company is now enjoying a near monopoly in the market for AI accelerators, given its first-mover advantage and its integrated suite of AI solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, analysts have warned that the AI bubble could burst after remaining active for three to five years. Since technology is ever-evolving, who knows, Nvidia could end up spearheading the next technology breakthrough too. Venture Capitalist <strong>Peter Thiel </strong>said in a recent podcast that <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/08/40475377/palantir-co-founder-peter-thiel-says-ai-could-take-15-20-years-to-become-super-dominant-calls-this-t\">he expects AI to take something like two decades to become &#8220;super dominant&#8221;</a> but that doesn't distract from it being a &#8220;really big deal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entrepreneur expects AI to rearrange the economic, cultural and political structure of our society in extremely dramatic ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immediate test for Nvidia would be its second-quarter results due Wednesday. &nbsp;The company is widely expected to report earnings of 64 cents per share and revenue of $28.46 billion, according to <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro data.</a> This compares to the year-ago's 25 cents (split-adjusted) and $13.51 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In premarket trading on Thursday, Nvidia edged up 0.02% to $128.52, according to <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Next:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40479226/nvidia-down-about-10-from-all-time-highs-prominent-trader-says-he-has-cashed-out-of\">Nvidia Down About 10% From All-Time Highs: Prominent Trader Says He Has Cashed Out Of The Stock Barely A Week Ahead Of Earnings And Will &#8216;Decide On Re-entering&#8217; Later</a></em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image Via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T09:20:29Z", "headline": "Nvidia Stock To Surge To $340 In Medium Term?

For public companies like MicroStrategy, this includes issuing convertible bonds and equity to purchase Bitcoin, effectively creating a \"Bitcoin balance sheet.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Sailor figured out how to give a bond market starved of yield exposure to Bitcoin volatility,\" LeClair noted. This allowed MicroStrategy to borrow at extremely low rates and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LeClair noted that while this strategy seemed risky to many, it has paid off handsomely. MicroStrategy&#8217;s market cap has grown from $1 billion to over $30 billion since implementing this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LeClair believes more companies will adopt versions of this playbook as Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance. However, he cautioned that fully embracing the strategy remains a &#8220;radical step&#8221; for most corporations at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29155259/905735A6-57D3-4874-9AA1-75D037842DB3-2.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-270548\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40128336/microstrategy-stock-has-soared-1200-since-adding-bitcoin-to-its-balance-sheet-outpacing-nv\">MicroStrategy Stock Has Soared 1200% Since Adding Bitcoin to Its Balance Sheet, Outpacing Nvidia&#8217;s Returns: What You Should Know</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The strategy isn&#8217;t limited to public companies. Real Bedford FC, an 8th-tier English football club, has accumulated 82 Bitcoin using similar principles.

If companies choose to cut labor, in response, and  job losses rise significantly, it could put the soft landing at risk, she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carson Group&#8217;s <strong>Ryan Detrick </strong>noted that the S&amp;P 500 Index has been above the 200-day moving average for more than 200 days now.

Over 95% of the creditors who submitted their votes were in favor of the plan, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-says-creditors-overwhelmingly-back-reorganization-plan-627fb1f2?mod=latest_headlines\">reported</a> the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final voting results will be submitted to the bankruptcy court before the confirmation hearing scheduled for October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40449413/donald-trump-cuts-kamala-harris-election-odds-lead-to-4-points-but-he-leads-in-these-2-cru?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donald Trump Cuts Kamala Harris&#8217; Election Odds Lead To 4 Points, But He Leads In These 2 Crucial Swing States</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The overwhelming support for FTX&#8217;s reorganization plan comes in the wake of a tumultuous period for the company. Earlier this month, a U.S. judge ordered FTX and <strong>Alameda Research</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40248878/ftx-alameda-ordered-to-pay-12-7b-to-creditors-by-u-s-judge\">pay $12.7 billion in restitution and disgorgement</a> to creditors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, accusing the two entities of fraud and misrepresentations about the state of FTX&#8217;s operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before that, in July, the Securities and Exchange Commission had initiated a lawsuit against Silvergate Capital, a bank significantly impacted by the downfall of FTX.

This bid marks a significant leap from his prior offer of $4.3 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro,</a> at the time of writing. Paramount&#8217;s Global Class A PARAA was trading 2.50% while its Global Class B Stock was up by 3.43%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paramount acknowledged the receipt of an acquisition proposal from Bronfman on behalf of a group of investors on Wednesday. The company, however, did not reveal the terms of the offer. Paramount's special committee also declared a 15-day extension to the \"go shop\" period of its merger agreement with Skydance, as it scrutinizes Bronfman&#8217;s rival offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bronfman&#8217;s updated bid encompasses $3.2 billion in funds that can be utilized to settle Paramount&#8217;s debt or to acquire non-voting Paramount shares held by investors outside the Redstone family. The board and the Bronfman-led investor group will determine the allocation of these funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40493514/donald-trump-now-leads-kamala-harris-by-5-points-after-10-point-election-odds-turnaround-i?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donald Trump Now Leads Kamala Harris By 5 Points After 10-Point Election Odds Turnaround In Only 7 Days</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bronfman&#8217;s new offer poses a potential disruption to a planned acquisition by tech heir David Ellison and his company Skydance Media. If successful, Bronfman&#8217;s bid would cover a $400 million break fee owed to Skydance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The special board committee has extended the deadline until Sept. 5 for Bronfman&#8217;s consortium, Paramount announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Earlier this month, Bronfman was reportedly in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40414119/former-warner-music-boss-edgar-bronfman-jr-reportedly-sets-sights-on-paramount-global-and-national-a\">talks with various individuals </a>and companies to support his bid, including <strong>Fortress Investment Group</strong> and Hollywood producer <strong>Steven Paul</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days ago, Bronfman submitted a bid of $4.3 billion, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/08/40467003/paramount-bidding-war-intensifies-as-edgar-bronfman-counters-skydance-with-4-3b-offer-plans\">planning to raise </a>more in the coming days as the deadline for Paramount bids approached.

The firm has a significant market share lead in converter chips, which are used to translate analog signals to digital and vice versa. The company serves tens of thousands of customers, and more than half of its chip sales are made to industrial and automotive end markets. Analog Devices' chips are also incorporated into wireless infrastructure equipment.</p>\n<h3>Analog Devices's Economic Impact: An Analysis</h3>\n<p><strong>Market Capitalization Analysis:</strong> Positioned below industry benchmarks, the company's market capitalization faces constraints in size. This could be influenced by factors such as growth expectations or operational capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Decline in Revenue:</strong> Over the 3 months period, Analog Devices faced challenges, resulting in a decline of approximately <strong>-33.83%</strong> in revenue growth as of 30 April, 2024. This signifies a reduction in the company's top-line earnings.

She echoed the sentiment of <strong>Raoul Pal</strong>, who also recently termed Bitcoin a \"standout asset\" thanks to its 150% yearly average gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst also noted that the recent market meltdown and quick recovery highlighted the &#8220;fragility&#8221; of the financial system and investors&#8217; reliance on central bank intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s price action, Alden stated that its strongest correlation is with global liquidity, which has been flat for about two years. This accounts for Bitcoin&#8217;s recent sideways trading, despite the launch of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-spot-bitcoin-etfs\">spot ETFs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, she remains &#8220;fairly constructive&#8221; on Bitcoin&#8217;s outlook for 2025, anticipating a more pro-liquidity environment as the Federal Reserve potentially eases monetary policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/ \"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29155259/905735A6-57D3-4874-9AA1-75D037842DB3-2.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-270548\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40401620/bitcoins-last-downturn-put-sentiment-on-suicide-watch-but-experts-see-a-silver-lining\">Bitcoin&#8217;s Last Downturn Put Sentiment On &#8216;Suicide Watch,&#8217; But Experts See A Silver Lining</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Alden emphasized the importance of Bitcoin&#8217;s growing technological capabilities, particularly in privacy and efficiency. She highlighted the launch of several eCash wallets and improvements in payment discovery through platforms like Nostr, stating these developments are &#8220;cool to see&#8221; and empower diverse communities globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the political front, Alden noted growing bipartisan support for Bitcoin in the U.S., which she sees as crucial for protecting against potential hostile government actions. She expressed neutrality on proposals for a national <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/07/39866338/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-reserve-asset-for-the-us-expert-details-how-trump-could-make-it-hap\">Bitcoin strategic reserve</a> but acknowledged it could send a &#8220;very positive signal&#8221; to other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, Alden expects continued fiscal dominance and currency debasement in developed economies, potentially leading to &#8220;emerging market-like characteristics&#8221; in their monetary policies.

{"author": "Shanthi Rexaline", "content": "<p>Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> stirred up the hornet&#8217;s nest by hinting at a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/08/40485064/wall-street-labels-kamala-harris-proposed-tax-on-unrealized-gains-as-dumb-move-opposite-of-creating\">potential tax on unrealized capital gains </a>and hedge-fund manager <strong>Bill Ackman </strong>on Wednesday joined  the debate with his view on the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Ackman was responding to independent journalist <strong>Lee Fang&#8217;s </strong>point on people in the $10 billion+ range of wealth skirting tax payment. While acknowledging that there were problems with the tax on unrealized gains proposal, Fang said, &#8220;The people in the $10 billion+ range of wealth pay nearly zero income taxes, borrow till death, then heirs get a cost basis reset to pay zero capital gains,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The way to fix this problem is to make borrowing an amount in excess of your basis in a stock taxable.

Explaining further, he noted that if one possesses $10 billion in stock in a company he founded with zero basis, loans secured by the stock should be taxable as if a like amount of stock was sold. &#8220;If you borrowed $1 billion you would have a capital gain of $1 billion,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This would be both fair and practical to implement,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ackman said for this a step up in basis equal to the loan amount should be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Important: </strong>Democratic presidential candidate Harris hinted at the party&#8217;s national convention earlier this week that she supported an annual 25% minimum tax on the unrealized gains of individuals with income and assets that exceed $100 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wall Street analysts and strategists cried foul over the proposal, with Fund Strat Head of Research Tom Lee, calling it a &#8221;\u00a0very unstable tax policy,&#8221; which would penalize those investing with a long-term perspective.

The deal, valued at $1.08 billion, involves selling a 20% stake to<strong> Nippon Steel </strong>(OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NISTF#OTC\">NISTF</a>) and a 10% stake to <strong>JFE Steel</strong>, two <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/steel\">leading Japanese steelmakers.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per Bloomberg's <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/08/21/whitehaven-coal-to-sell-stake-in-blackwater-for-108-billion/\">report</a>, Whitehaven will manage this new yet unnamed joint venture, securing a long-term supply of high-quality coal for Nippon Steel and JFE Steel&#8217;s steel production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As long-term customers of Blackwater, their co-investment reflects the importance of Blackwater metallurgical coal in the seaborne market. The formation of this joint venture with such high-quality participants validates the asset purchase by Whitehaven, the coal quality, and Whitehaven's plans as the operator of Blackwater,&#8221; said Whitehaven's CEO, <strong>Paul Flynn</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/24/08/40483226/consol-energy-and-arch-resources-to-merge-in-5b-domestic-coal-entity\">Consol Energy And Arch Resources To Merge In $5B Domestic Coal Entity</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement includes market-based offtake agreements that guarantee a steady flow of Blackwater coal to these major customers when the global coal industry faces uncertainty due to the shift towards cleaner energy sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We decided to invest to ensure stable raw material procurement and secure earnings even if market conditions change,\" Nippon Steel's managing executive officer <strong>Ryuichi Nagai</strong> told Reuters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue striving to secure quality resources,&#8221; he added, expressing openness to acquiring more assets in the sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blackwater coal mine, one of Australia&#8217;s largest metallurgical coal mines, produces between 12 million and 13 million tons of coal annually, with a strike length of 80 kilometers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitehaven purchased the Blackwater mine in April 2023 as part of a $4.1 billion deal with <strong>BHP</strong> and <strong>Mitsubishi Corp</strong> that also included the <strong>Daunia</strong> mine. The acquisition transformed Whitehaven from a New South Wales-focused coal producer into a significant player in Queensland's coal industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the sale of a stake in Blackwater, Whitehaven will reduce debt and potentially increase shareholder returns. Flynn noted that the deal &#8220;will immediately strengthen Whitehaven's balance sheet and provide enhanced financial flexibility.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/24/08/40424535/gold-mining-m-a-heats-up-as-rising-metal-prices-boost-cash\">Gold Mining M&amp;A Heats Up As Rising Metal Prices Boost Cash</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Benzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

{"author": "Avi Kapoor", "content": "<p><strong>Ross Stores, Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ROST#NASDAQ\">ROST</a>) is expected to release earnings results for its second quarter, after the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/ROST/earnings\">closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 22.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts expect the Dublin, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.5 per share, up from $1.32 per share in the year-ago period. Ross Stores is projected to post revenue of $5.25 billion, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Aug. 21, Ross Stores said its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 36.75 cents per common share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent buzz around Ross Stores, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Ross Stores has a dividend yield of 0.95%. That&#8217;s a quarterly dividend amount of 36.75 cents a share ($1.47 a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Ross Stores, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we take this amount and divide it by Ross Stores' $1.47 dividend: $6,000 / $1.47 &nbsp;= 4,082 shares</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, an investor would need to own approximately $628,424 worth of Ross Stores, or 4,082 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.47 = 816 shares, or $125,623 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same.

The company eases access to and use of siloed, disconnected data that enterprises have without &#8220;expensive rip and replace&#8221; processes, he said, adding &#8220;Palantir makes every company&#8217;s data great, and thus, fuels great enterprise AI.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracing the evolution of AI, Latimore noted that the first advancement involved computers recognizing basic anomalies in data, the next incremental value came from automated insights and the third step was automated decisions. &#8220;Palantir elevates all three AI areas for a company, and greatly advance decisions,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-artificial-intelligence-stocks\">Best AI Stocks</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst noted that AI drives material efficiencies, new revenue sources and security, with the addressable markets growing at a 30%+ rate. Use cases will likely expand over time within the companies, he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palantir is a &#8220;way to invest in the rapidly emerging, diverse enterprise AI market,&#8221; the analyst said, adding that the company&#8217;s enterprise segment is accelerating, helping to propel the entire business, which currently depends on governments for 50% of its revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We estimate Palantir to hit 59 on the rule of 40 in FY24 and 57 in FY25. This top tier metric suggests PLTR should be able to trade at 22x revenue in a year, putting the stock at $35,&#8221; the analyst said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst said he would look to buy this enterprise AI leader on dips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In premarket trading, Palantir rose 0.21% to $32.61, according to <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Next:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/technicals/24/08/40318702/palantirs-ai-triumph-is-a-new-bull-market-on-the-horizon\"><strong>Palantir&#8217;s AI Triumph: Is A New Bull Market On The Horizon?</strong></a></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T12:54:46Z", "headline": "Palantir Leader In 'Rapidly Emerging, Diverse Enterprise AI Market,' Says Analyst, But Prefers To Stay On Sidelines: Here's Why", "id": 40506202, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Palantir-stock.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Palantir-stock.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Palantir-stock.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Palantir is increasingly becoming synonymous with enterprise AI usage, with the addressable markets growing at a 30%+ rate, says analyst.", "symbols": ["PLTR"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T12:54:47Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40506202/palantir-leader-in-rapidly-emerging-diverse-enterprise-ai-market-says-analyst-but-p"}

{"author": "Abbey Higginbotham", "content": "<p>As the cannabis industry grapples with ongoing legal and financial challenges, companies are looking for ways to navigate a complex environment. <strong>Ross Gerber</strong>, co-founder, president, and CEO of <strong>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management</strong>, shared his views on how cannabis businesses can better position themselves for success ahead of the upcoming <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/cannabis-conference/\">Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</a></strong>, where he will speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber, a long-time advocate and investor in the cannabis space, highlighted the financial challenges many companies face due to federal regulations. One of the primary obstacles is the burden of excessive taxation under the 280E tax code, which limits profitability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The federal laws have created two major barriers for cannabis companies\u2014over-taxation and restricted access to capital markets,\" Gerber explained. These issues make it difficult for even well-managed companies to thrive in the current environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Capital Structure Challenge</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber emphasized the importance of financial discipline in this restrictive landscape. According to him, managing a company's capital structure is crucial. \"What matters most is whether these companies are cash flow positive and how they handle debt in an environment where interest rates can be exorbitant,\" he said. For Gerber, companies that can maintain financial stability despite these challenges are more likely to emerge as leaders in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The restrictions on raising capital through traditional U.S. exchanges further complicate matters for cannabis businesses. Gerber pointed out that many companies are forced to seek funding in less favorable markets, such as Canada, where interest rates are high. \"These companies are essentially stuck in a financial bind, unable to raise funds on U.S. exchanges and paying high rates to secure capital elsewhere,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40506425/new-sec-filings-reveal-major-risks-in-cannabis-etfs-following-recent-volatility-but-theres-still\">New SEC Filings Reveal Major Risks In Cannabis ETFs Following Recent Volatility \u2014 But There&#8217;s Still Room for Optimism</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Potential Impact of Federal Rescheduling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber also discussed the potential effects of federal cannabis rescheduling on the financial health of cannabis companies. He believes rescheduling could provide much-needed relief by reducing tax burdens and opening access to traditional banking services. \"Removing the federal legality issue would significantly improve the financial performance of these companies,\" Gerber said. This change could allow companies to refinance their debt and reduce operational costs, making them more competitive in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Gerber cautioned that rescheduling alone is not a panacea. Cannabis companies need to be prepared for the regulatory changes that would follow. He stressed the importance of staying financially disciplined and ready to adapt to new opportunities that may arise from changes in federal law.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategic Management Is A Must</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the industry anticipates possible federal changes, Gerber advised cannabis companies to focus on financial health and strong management. \"The companies that can refinance their debt and reduce costs will see their value increase significantly,\" he said. Companies can better position themselves for success in a competitive market by maintaining financial discipline and being ready for legal shifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/cannabis-conference/\">Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</a></strong> will offer a platform for industry leaders like Gerber to share their insights and strategies. As the cannabis industry continues to evolve, events like this provide valuable opportunities for businesses to learn from experts and prepare for the challenges ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gerber&#8217;s message to cannabis companies is clear: prioritize financial stability, prepare for potential legal changes, and ensure strong leadership. These elements are essential for navigating the current challenges and positioning for future success in the cannabis industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40498372/can-cannabis-help-with-the-obesity-crisis-in-the-us-new-study-sheds-light-on-the-matter\"><strong>Can Cannabis Help With The Obesity Crisis In The US?

With this innovation, we can reach even more people and continue growing the brand.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The THC-infused beverage promises effects within 15 minutes of consumption, offering a compelling alternative to alcohol. The experience is light, smooth and refreshing, without any of the hangover effects associated with traditional alcoholic drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A limited preview sale for Nowadays THC Canned Cocktails began today, with six packs available for purchase at trynowadays.com. General sales will begin the week of September 2nd, retailing at $31.95 for a six-pack of 12oz cans.

Discover more insights in our analysis as of August 22, 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>EUR/USD Continues Its Upward Momentum</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>US Dollar Weakens Rapidly Due to Dovish Federal Reserve Tone and Mixed Employment Data</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>EUR/USD Forecast for August 22, 2024: Target Levels at 1.1195 and 1.1073</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fundamental Analysis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday, the EUR/USD rate surged to 1.1105, reaching levels last seen in December 2023. The primary driver behind the US dollar&#39;s decline is the Federal Reserve&#39;s increasingly dovish outlook. Additionally, recent signs of a weakening employment market further weigh on the USD, as investors now anticipate the Fed will move towards easing monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest minutes from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s July 30-31 meeting revealed a growing inclination among policymakers to lower interest rates, with some members favoring immediate action. The tone of the meeting was notably softer than expected, reinforcing expectations of potential rate cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further adding to the dollar&#39;s troubles, data released by the Department of Labor yesterday showed fewer jobs were created than previously reported, exacerbating concerns about the US economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are pricing in a 62% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s next meeting, with the likelihood of a larger 50-basis-point cut rising to 38%, up from 33% just a day earlier. Despite this, the EUR/USD forecast remains stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>EUR/USD Technical Analysis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the H4 chart, EUR/USD has broken above the 1.1135 level and completed a growth wave, pushing the rate up to 1.1173. The pair is expected to retest the 1.1135 level from above today, August 22, 2024. If this support level fails, it could lead to a decline towards 1.1073. However, a breakout above this range could open the door to further growth, with the next target set at 1.1195. After reaching this level, a reversal towards 1.1073 is anticipated, potentially extending the downward trend towards the next target of 1.0980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/eurusd-2024-08-22.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/eurusd-2024-08-22.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Summary</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR/USD pair continues to rise, reaching new highs in 2024. Current technical indicators suggest that the upward momentum could extend to 1.1195, signaling the completion of this growth phase. A subsequent downward correction towards 1.1073 is likely, with the potential for further declines ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author&#39;s particular opinion.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>The possibility of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8216;s return to the White House has triggered a surge in investments in European defense-tech startups, as per industry executives and investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Trump&#8217;s unpredictable approach towards NATO and defense budgets has led to a rise in military spending and investment in defense-tech startups across Europe. The former president is currently in a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris for the Nov. 5 election, Reuters reported on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global military spending hit a record high of $2.4 trillion in 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In June, the NATO Innovation Fund (NIF) announced partnerships with venture capital firms and defense startups across Europe, aiming to strengthen security in the region. The European Union also pledged over $1 billion towards military innovation earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the potential of a Trump presidency wasn&#8217;t the only factor driving these initiatives, it has significantly influenced investments in manufacturers of drones, robotics, and quantum computing, according to eight industry executives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40453368/bernie-sanders-trump-labeled-kamala-harris-an-extreme-communist-on-her-price-gauging-plan-but-doesnt?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bernie Sanders: Trump Labeled Kamala Harris An &#8216;Extreme Communist&#8217; On Her Price Gauging Plan, But Doesn&#8217;t \u00a0Matter What He Says, No One Believes Him</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the leading investors is Munich-based <strong>Vsquared Ventures</strong>, which recently raised a 214 million euro ($237.99 million) fund to invest in space, robotics, and other technologies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Trump&#8217;s threats have made European states think very differently about investing in their own capabilities and giving contracts out, often to startups,&#8221; said <strong>Herbert Mangesius</strong>, founding partner at Vsquared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the NIF is backed by 24 NATO countries, with eight remaining countries &#8211; including Canada and the U.S. &#8211; not involved. Andrea Traversone, the organization&#8217;s managing partner, expressed his ambition to have all NATO allies join the fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defense and security spending across Europe rose 16% to 552 billion euros since 2022, as per SIPRI data. This increase in spending has resulted in governments partnering with new technology companies and investing more in their defense capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Trump&#8217;s potential return and his past comments <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/02/37061734/biden-says-if-trump-able-to-gain-power-again-he-will-let-russia-do-whatever-the-hell-they-want-with\">concerning NATO allies </a>and defense spending have raised concerns among European nations. Trump hinted that the U.S. might not defend NATO allies who fail to meet their defense spending targets against a potential Russian invasion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These comments, coupled with escalating tensions with Russia and China, have led to a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/04/38155210/western-nations-may-face-10-trillion-defense-spending-surge-amid-russia-china-threat-report\">surge in defense spending</a> by Western nations, which could surpass $10 trillion in the next decade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action: </strong>In the U.S., defense ETFs such as<strong> Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PPA#NYSE\">PPA</a>) was trading 0.19% higher at $111.02, <strong>SPDR S&amp;P Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XAR#NYSE\">XAR</a>) was trading 0.17% higher at $152.29 while <strong>iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF</strong> (BATS:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ITA#BATS\">ITA</a>) was trading 0.28% higher at $144.30, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Congress Is Making Huge Investments.\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was generated using <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\">Benzinga Neuro</a> and edited by <u><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/Pooja-Rajkumari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pooja Rajkumari</a></u></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T13:55:17Z", "headline": "Trump's Potential Return Triggers Investors' Demand For European Defense Startups", "id": 40508166, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Dotcoms-Allegation.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Dotcoms-Allegation.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Dotcoms-Allegation.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "While the potential of a Trump presidency wasn&#39;t the only factor driving these initiatives, it has significantly influenced investments.", "symbols": ["ITA", "PPA", "XAR"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T13:55:18Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40508166/trumps-potential-return-triggers-investors-demand-for-european-defense-startups"}

{"author": "RIPS", "content": "<p>Good Morning Traders! In today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#39;s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#39;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The SPY is currently positioned around our level of 561.90. For the bullish scenario, we&#39;d like to see an initial move higher towards 563.23. If the price action remains robust above 563.23, we&#39;re targeting a potential rise to 564.29. If 564.29 sustains as support during regular trading hours, it could pave the way for a push towards 565.38. Our high target for a bullish outcome today on SPY is 566.46.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, if 561.90 fails to hold as support, we expect the bears to test the waters at 560.83. If sellers gain traction, they may drive the price lower to 559.75. Should this level break down under heavy selling pressure, we&rsquo;re eyeing a more substantial support level at 558.32. If the session turns aggressively bearish, our low target for SPY would be 557.44.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Q&#39;s are currently around our key level of 483.95. For the bullish case, we need to see buyers maintain control above 483.95. If this level holds as support, we&#39;re looking at a potential move to 486.10. Sustained buying pressure could push the price up to 487.69. If the auction remains strong today, we might see a test of the higher level at 490.05. The high bull target for QQQ today is set at 491.82.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if 483.95 struggles to hold during the session, we anticipate the bears could take over, driving the price down to 481.73. Continued weakness may lead to a test of the lower level at 479.03. If sellers maintain their grip, we expect the auction to probe 476.85. Should this level give way, the bears could push the Q&#39;s down to the low target of 474.66.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apple Inc. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple is currently trading near our level of 226.90. For a bullish outlook, we&#39;re watching for 226.90 to be held firmly as support. If buyers succeed in maintaining this level, we could see a move higher to 227.82. Continued bullish momentum could drive the price towards 229.03. If the bulls remain in control, our high bull target for the day on Apple is 230.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if 226.90 fails to hold as support, we anticipate a test of the lower level at 225.31. Persistent selling pressure could push the price further down to 223.87. If the downside continues, 222.96 could come into play as the next support level. Should this level break, we&#39;re looking at a potential drop to our low target for the day at 222.24.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft is currently trading around the 423.81 level. For the bullish scenario, we&#39;re looking for the auction to hold above 423.81 and move towards 425.16. If 425.16 can establish itself as support, it could trigger a rally towards 426.00. Continued bullish action may drive the price to our high bull target for the day on Microsoft at 427.36.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, if 423.81 doesn&rsquo;t hold as support, we&#39;re expecting the bears to challenge 422.84. A break below this level could see the price moving down to 421.62. If selling pressure intensifies, the bears could push the price lower to 420.26. Our low target for the day on Microsoft is set at 419.17.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NVIDIA is currently trading around the key level of 129.53. For the bulls, we want to see a push towards 131.42 and for this level to be reclaimed as a significant support zone. If the bulls can hold above this level, a move to 132.19 could be on the cards. Further buying could drive a rally to 133.31, with the high bull target for the day set at 134.56.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, however, 129.53 cannot hold as support in today&#39;s session, we anticipate a test of the lower level at 128.10. Should this level be broken, we might see the price drop to 126.84. Continued bearish momentum could bring 125.21 into focus. If the pressure persists, our low bear target for NVIDIA would be 123.41.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alphabet is currently around the level of 167.04. For the bullish scenario, we need 167.04 to hold as support, with the potential for the auction to move higher towards 169.34. If the buying continues, we could see the price moving up towards our high bull target of 171.14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if 167.04 fails to hold, we expect the bears to drive the price down to 165.41. A break below this level could see the auction testing 163.79. If selling pressure increases, the bears might push the price down to our low target for the day at 161.79.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Meta Platforms Inc </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta is currently positioned around 534.33. For a bullish outlook, we want to see this level hold as support, with the potential for the price to move higher to 537.68. If the buying pressure is strong, we could see a further push towards 541.79. If the bulls maintain their strength, the high target for Meta today is 548.44.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 534.33 fails to hold during the session, we&rsquo;re watching for the bears to push the price down to 531.03. Continued selling could see the price drop further to 526.29. If this level breaks, we&rsquo;re looking at a potential move down to our low bear target for Meta at 520.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tesla Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla is currently trading near 223.98. For the bulls, we&rsquo;re looking for a push towards 226.53, with continued buying potentially driving the price to our key level of 228.45. If the broader market sees a bullish rally today, Tesla might test the higher level at 230.65. With significant buying activity, the price could reach the high bull target at 233.49.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the downside, if 223.98 doesn&rsquo;t hold as support, we anticipate a move lower to 222.19. Further selling could bring 220.65 into play. Should this level break, the price may drop to our low target for Tesla today at 219.39.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Word: Today&rsquo;s trading session brings several key data points that could influence market movements. The morning kicks off with the Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims at 8:30 AM ET, providing insights into the labor market. At 9:45 AM ET, we&rsquo;ll get the Preliminary S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI for August, which could shed light on economic activity.

In the afternoon, at 1:00 PM ET, the Treasury&rsquo;s 30-Year TIPS Auction will take place, which could have implications for long-term interest rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the mix of labor market data, manufacturing indicators, and housing market updates, today&rsquo;s session is likely to be dynamic. Traders should stay alert, manage risk carefully, and be prepared to adapt to the evolving market conditions.

The minutes from the Fed&rsquo;s last meeting, released recently, revealed a consensus among monetary policymakers for an impending interest rate reduction. Some members advocate for immediate action, fueling speculation about an imminent easing of monetary policy. This anticipation exerts downward pressure on the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further focus is on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#39;s forthcoming speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, scheduled for Friday. The financial community eagerly awaits his comments, which could provide clearer indications of the Fed&#39;s policy trajectory heading into the remainder of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Japan, significant events include a speech by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda to the parliament, where he is expected to discuss the implications of the recent interest rate hike. Additionally, Japan&#39;s inflation data due for release on Friday will be crucial in assessing the domestic economic environment and could influence BoJ&#39;s future policy decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Technical Analysis Of USD/JPY</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/usdjpyh4_29.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/usdjpyh4_29.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:624px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD/JPY is currently exhibiting a consolidation pattern around the 146.15 level. A downward breakout targeting 142.88 is anticipated, which is seen as a key corrective level. Post-correction, the market might initiate a new growth phase aiming for 150.55, potentially extending to 156.00 if the upper threshold is breached. The MACD indicator supports a bullish outlook long-term, with the signal line positioned below zero but trending upwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u117641/usdjpyh1_27.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the hourly chart, USD/JPY is progressing through a correction phase with a target set at a minimum of 143.00. Following this corrective phase, expectations lean towards a resurgence in price, potentially reaching 147.70, and if momentum sustains, aiming further for 150.55. The Stochastic oscillator underscores this view, with its signal line poised below 80, suggesting a downward movement towards 20 before a probable rebound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors and traders are advised to monitor these developments closely, as outcomes from these events could significantly sway market dynamics and the trajectory of the USD/JPY pair in the near term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disclaimer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Any forecasts contained herein are based on the author&#39;s particular opinion.

{"author": "Benzinga Neuro", "content": "<p>In a recent interview, <strong>Ryan McIntyre, </strong>Managing Partner at <strong>Sprott Inc.</strong>, forecasted a bright future for gold prices, expecting them to remain &#8216;very positive&#8217; for the next 18 months and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: McIntyre appeared on CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Squawk Box&#8221; on Wednesday to discuss the record highs in gold prices. He attributed the surge to several factors, including increased buying by central banks and recent inflows into ETFs backed by gold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To us, that&#8217;s a whole new source of madness coming in. So we see gold as being very positive over the next 18 months and beyond, frankly,&#8221; McIntyre said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McIntyre also highlighted the fiscal situation of many Western governments as a significant driver behind the spike in gold demand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re running 7% deficits today, in a nonrecessionary environment, which is pretty unique circumstance,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40501889/nvidia-stock-to-surge-to-340-in-medium-term-portfolio-manager-sees-strong-rally-int?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia Stock To Surge To $340 In Medium Term?

The price of gold has been on an \"uninterrupted rally\" since October when it was priced at $1,810 an ounce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have intensified the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/08/40445319/gold-nears-record-highs-amid-geopolitical-uncertainty-and-fed-speculations\"> demand for safe-haven assets</a> like gold, pushing its price near record peaks.

In addition, newly appointed board member Robert Blaine Aitken Jr. purchased 3,000 shares of the stock on Aug. 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such purchases are highly symbolic, reflecting top management&rsquo;s confidence in the company while also suggesting that the shares remain undervalued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yum China, which is dual-listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, runs more than 15,000 stores in China, including the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. It has been an independent company since its spinoff from&nbsp;<strong>Yum Brands</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/YUM#NYSE\">YUM</a>) in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has also been aggressively buying back its stock, spending a collective $249 million in the second quarter on share buybacks and dividends. Yum China has repurchased nearly $1 billion worth of its stock so far this year, with buybacks totaling $2.83 billion since 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s U.S. shares rose 12% on Aug. 6 after Yum China reported industry-beating results, which included revenue, profit and margin gains, even as other global restaurant chains reported difficulties in the China market amid a challenging macro environment. The stock maintained those gains and continued to rally slightly in the following week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yum China&rsquo;s revenue grew 4% in the second quarter to $2.68 billion on a constant currency basis, roughly double the 2% growth for the broader restaurant sector, as the company opened a net 401 new stores to bring its total to 15,423. The company seized on its market clout and greater efficiencies, including through the rollout of AI-automated &ldquo;iKitchens&rdquo; at its Pizza Hut stores, to boost its core operating profit by 12% year-on-year for the quarter, while increasing overall operating margin to 9.9% from 9.7% a year earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

{"author": "Abbey Higginbotham", "content": "<p>As the cannabis industry grows, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/cannabis-beverages\">hemp-derived THC beverages</a> are gaining attention for their potential to reshape the market. With low-dose offerings that cater to consumer preferences, these beverages offer an alternative to alcohol, appealing to those seeking convenience and avoiding the effects of traditional alcoholic drinks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the future of this emerging market faces challenges as the <strong>2024 Farm Bill </strong>approaches, bringing the possibility of regulatory changes that could affect the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Potential of Hemp-Derived THC Beverages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Grey</strong>, managing director of equity research at <strong>Alliance Global Partners</strong> and upcoming speaker at the <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/cannabis-conference/\">Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</a></strong>, has identified hemp-derived THC beverages as a significant opportunity. He believes that these beverages have the potential to make a substantial impact on the THC market, which has struggled to gain traction in the cannabis industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grey points out that &#8220;the combination of being on-trend with consumer preferences\u2014convenience, no hangover, and a shift from alcohol\u2014positions the THC beverage category to expand the consumer demographic.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact is already felt in Minnesota, where regulations have allowed for broader distribution of these products.

This example showcases the demand for these products when they are accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grey projects that, with federal regulations allowing for broader distribution, the hemp-derived THC beverage market could reach $13.5 billion.

One possibility is that current regulations continue, allowing the market to grow under state-by-state rules. Another potential outcome could involve stricter regulations or even a ban on synthetic and naturally derived THC products, which would significantly impact the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grey stresses the importance of regulatory clarity at the federal level. He believes consistent regulations would enable broader distribution and help the market reach its full potential. &#8220;Operators selling hemp-derived beverages and edibles could benefit greatly from clear regulations,&#8221; Grey notes. However, if the rules are too restrictive, the market&#8217;s growth could be limited, and some operators might struggle to adapt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preparing for the Future</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cannabis industry waits for the outcome of the 2024 Farm Bill, operators must stay informed and ready to adapt to potential changes. The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/cannabis-conference/\">Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</a>, scheduled for Oct. 8-9 in Chicago, will provide a platform for industry leaders to discuss these challenges and share strategies for success. Grey&#8217;s insights will be essential to these conversations as operators seek to position themselves to thrive in a rapidly changing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the future of hemp-derived THC beverages is uncertain, the growth potential is undeniable. By staying prepared and informed, operators can navigate the challenges ahead and capitalize on this promising market&#8217;s opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/08/40498372/can-cannabis-help-with-the-obesity-crisis-in-the-us-new-study-sheds-light-on-the-matter\"><strong>Can Cannabis Help With The Obesity Crisis In The US?

<b>27.12</b> is lower than the industry average by <b>0.62x</b>, suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of <b>5.96</b> which exceeds the industry average by <b>2.26x</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of <b>3.75</b>, surpassing the industry average by <b>1.7x</b>, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a Return on Equity (ROE) of <b>7.34%</b> that is <b>4.15%</b> above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With lower Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of <b>$40 Million</b>, which is <b>0.57x</b> below the industry average, the company may face lower profitability or financial challenges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With lower gross profit of <b>$80 Million</b>, which indicates <b>0.57x</b> below the industry average, the company may experience lower revenue after accounting for production costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company's revenue growth of <b>-3.75%</b> is significantly lower compared to the industry average of <b>3.9%</b>.

Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Fresh Vine Wine Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1724338823_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Fresh Vine Wine has grown since its last report.

This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; </strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

This Power Inflow shifts from a net selling or distribution phase to a net buying or accumulation environment, illustrating a significant inflow that exceeds outflow. Such a change is commonly viewed as a sign of heightened investor confidence and a short-term uptrend in the stock. At <strong>10:01 AM ET</strong> on August 14th<strong>, Super Micro Computer</strong> recorded a Power Inflow at a trading price of USD <strong>$606.36</strong> This occurrence is essential for investors who base their trading decisions on <strong>order flow analytics</strong>. The Power Inflow indicates the potential start of an uptrend in <strong>Super Micro Computer Inc.</strong> stock, presenting an opportunity for investors to profit from anticipated price rises. Bullish stakeholders diligently seek to confirm sustained positive momentum in<strong> SMCI stock</strong> price, and this development is viewed as a favorable sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Power Inflow signal description:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Order flow analytics, or transaction/market flow analysis, involves a comprehensive analysis of order volumes from both retail and institutional traders. This method scrutinizes the flow of buy and sell orders, paying close attention to factors such as order size, timing, and other relevant characteristics that form patterns to generate actionable insights and improve trading decisions.

Unscripted shows are believed to have a budget of around $400,000 per half-hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The streaming platform could launch later this year, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Gibson,</strong> who has worked on shows like \"Top Gear\" and \"The X Factor\" is said to be leading the platform's programming strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chick-fil-A previously helped produce content for its website, including short, animated \"Stories of Evergreen Hills\" films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company continues to rank as one of the top companies in the sector by sales per unit and has a loyal fan base that could help boost the presence of the streaming platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31380677/chick-fil-a-has-some-of-the-lowest-franchise-fees-highest-sales-in-fast-food-whats-the-catch\">Chick-fil-A Has Some Of The Lowest Franchise Fees, Highest Sales In Fast Food &#8211; What&#8217;s The Catch?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important</strong>: An interesting thought on the new Chick-fil-A streaming platform will be if it is available to use on Sundays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may seem farfetched and come with logistic struggles, this is a restaurant company that has gone to great lengths to be closed on Sundays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlanta-based company&#8217;s long-standing decision to be closed on Sundays dates back to its first location and comes from a religious background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our founder S. Truett Cathy made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. Having worked seven days a week in restaurants open 24 hours, Truett saw the importance of closing on Sundays so that he and his employees could set aside one day to rest or worship if they choose, a practice we uphold today,&#8221; the Chick-fil-A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chick-fil-a.com/customer-support/who-we-are/our-culture-and-values/why-is-chick-fil-a-closed-on-sunday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website&nbsp;</a>says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family has honored this decision and keeping the company private since Cathy passed away in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example of how far they will go in keeping their units closed on Sundays is the location located inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Georgia, home of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. Despite the Falcons playing the majority of their home games on Sunday, the Chick-fil-A stadium location remains closed on those game days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not even the stadium hosting Super Bowl LIII in 2019 could get the Chick-fil-A location to open up on Sunday for the marquee event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chick-fil-A has been the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/12/36363238/chick-fil-a-open-on-sundays-new-york-proposed-law-could-make-this-a-reality-for-some-locations\">potential law change </a>in New York for restaurant locations in travel centers and rest stops to be open on Sundays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans for a streaming platform outside of the entertainment industry aren't completely farfetched in the world of content creators and short-form content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lyft Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LYFT#NASDAQ\">LYFT</a>) and <strong>Airbnb </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ABNB#NASDAQ\">ABNB</a>) are companies mentioned in the report that are helping make original series like \"Lucky Lyft\" and \"Gay Chorus Deep South\" respectively.

He added that the guidance for fiscal 2025, although raised, continues to imply a deceleration in the back half of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \"key silver linings\" in Snowflake's results include solid bookings, driven by accelerating RPO growth \"with the closure of two nine-figure deals in Q2, alongside some ongoing subtle stabilization in DBNR (dollar-based net retention) trends,\" the analyst wrote. The pace of sequential DBNR contraction moderated for the fourth consecutive quarter, he further stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings\">other analyst stock ratings</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Needham </strong><strong>On </strong><strong>Snowflake</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/601a8839a6fe6f00010c6966/mike-cikos\">Analyst Mike Cikos</a> reiterated a Buy rating, while reducing the price target from $210 to $160.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snowflake's product revenue of $829.3 million represents 30% year-on-year growth, coming in higher than the consensus of $813.7 million, Cikos said. Gross and operating margins were also higher, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While, Snowflake exceeded its guidance and sell-side expectations for the July quarter, its shares declined as investors had expected stronger revenue growth for the October quarter and an increase in operating margin guidance, the analyst noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We believe investors are further confused by management&#8217;s decision to raise FY25 Revenue guidance off the current quarter&#8217;s 2% beat versus guidance while not raising guidance last quarter on the stronger 5% beat,&#8221; Cikos said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although net revenue retention continued to decline to 127%, from 128% in the prior quarter and 142% in the year-ago period, RPOs accelerated for the third consecutive quarter and total customer count increased, the analyst stated. Snowflake raised the midpoint of its product revenue guidance for the full year by $56 million, while maintaining its profitability outlook, the analyst added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goldman Sachs On </strong><strong>Snowflake</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/58c6ab8db85e9300015f1ae0/kash-rangan\">Analyst Kash Rangan</a> reaffirmed a Buy rating and price target of $220.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snowflake reported solid quarterly results, but its guidance fell short of high expectations, Rangan said. The stock came under pressure due to the \"lack of beat flow-through\" on operating and free cash flow margins and a \"growing dispersion between cRPO / RPO and forward revenue growth,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Snowflake's true beat-and-raise in a still constrained spending environment underscores the stability of consumption and optimization trends through mid-August,\" the analyst wrote. The company's NNR \"displayed the lowest rate of sequential deceleration in the past 2+ years,\" he further stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SNOW Price Action:</strong> Shares of Snowflake<strong> </strong>were down 13.5% to $116.71 at the time of publication on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40509090/august-services-growth-exceeds-expectations-as-manufacturing-slumps-inflation-gradually-eases-to-nor\"><strong>August Services Growth Exceeds Expectations As Manufacturing Slumps: Inflation Gradually Eases &#8216;To Normal Levels&#8217;</strong></a></li>\n</ul>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T16:05:03Z", "headline": "Snowflake Investors 'Further Confused' After Q2 Earnings: One Analyst Says They Know Why", "id": 40511947, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/snow-ai_0.png"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/snow-ai_0.png"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/snow-ai_0.png"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Shares of Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) tanked even after a beat-and-raise quarter.

The analyst noted that this premium encompasses the company&#8217;s dynamic growth and dominant industry position in building AI infrastructure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth-quarter gross margin reached a multi-year low, with only marginal improvement expected in the first quarter. Still, as per Blakey, a reiteration of the company&#8217;s 14%-17% long-term gross margin goal implies a substantial ramp in gross margin in the second half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blakey projected fiscal 2024 revenue and EPS of $29.32 billion and $43.89.

They are expected to return to the long-term range of 14%-17% during fiscal 2025, led by improving manufacturing efficiencies and demand from a broader group of CSPs with lower buying power, implying lower volume discounts and better cost footprint with a ramp in Malaysia manufacturing facility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chatterjee expects limited impact from the delays to <strong>Nvidia Corp&#8217;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell GPU solutions, as the company remains conservative in its plans around the availability of next-generation solutions while supporting customers in achieving lower TCO through liquid-cooled racks for current-generation compute solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chatterjee projected fiscal 2024 revenue and EPS of $27.98 billion and $34.03.

{"author": "The Bamboo Works", "content": "<h4><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Huya&rsquo;s revenue declined 16% in the second quarter, but income from its new game-related services more than doubled</li>\r\n\t<li>The company is trying to diversify its revenue in the face of a softening Chinese economy and low margins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>By Warren Yang</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Huya Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HUYA#NYSE\">HUYA</a>) has cleared a critical level in its diversification game. Now, it needs to up that game to return to revenue growth and boost its margins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last Tuesday, the operator of a livestreaming gaming platform&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huya-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results-and-announces-share-repurchase-program-extension-and-special-cash-dividend-302220868.html\">reported</a>&nbsp;a 16% year-on-year drop in its second-quarter revenue to 1.5 billion yuan ($212 million). That may look like cause for concern, but the results also featured a significant achievement that bodes well for the company as it attempts to return to growth after more than two years of revenue declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huya&rsquo;s revenue from game-related services other than streaming, such as advertising and in-game item sales, more than doubled to 308.5 million yuan during the quarter year-on-year to account for about 20% of the company&rsquo;s total. This marks rapid progress in its fledgling diversification effort, which got underway just last August as it sought to counter sagging revenue from its main streaming business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company expects revenue from game-related services to keep growing at double-digit rates sequentially in the current quarter compared with the April-June period, acting co-CEO Huang Junhong said on a conference call to discuss the latest quarterly results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Overall, we are confident that the game-related services business will continue to expand in the future,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huya is facing challenges on a number of fronts, sending its revenue into contraction mode starting in 2022 after years of growth. China&rsquo;s broader gaming sector has taken a big hit in the past few years as Beijing used regulatory means to curb minors from spending too much time playing games. The crackdown also included limits on how much minors can tip their favorite gamers, dealing a blow to a major source of income for companies like Huya that take a cut of such payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, a key difficulty for the company and its peers is the economic headwinds now blowing through China, which can dampen enthusiasm not only for gaming, but also sales of virtual gifts and other digital items that viewers buy for themselves and their favorite gamers. Such discretionary spending is broadly under pressure in China, as increasingly cautious consumers scale back on non-essential purchases in the current environment of economic uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Low-Margin Business</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These headwinds aside, Huya&rsquo;s business model fundamentally involves high costs, which erode its margins to strikingly low levels for a technology company. It shares the bulk of its revenue with streamers and their agencies, and it also incurs costs for content licensing and production. These expenses leave Huya with thin gross profit margins in the low double-digit range. What&rsquo;s worse, that figure is falling, to 13.9% in the second quarter from 15.7% a year earlier as production costs for self-made content grew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s newer game-related services carry higher margins, so growth of that business should eventually help Huya improve its overall profitability, even if that effect wasn&rsquo;t showing up in the latest quarterly results. Demand for those services may also be less sensitive to shifts in the economic climate since they involve relationships with other businesses, which are more stable than relationships with individual, small-time consumers who are the main viewers of its streaming shows. The new products are also less prone to regulatory crackdowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Big Dividend</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors cheered the quick progress Huya has made in cultivating the new business, and they also welcomed the company&rsquo;s extension of an existing share buyback program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of all, they probably appreciated the company&rsquo;s announcement of a relatively large special cash dividend of $1.08 per American depositary share (ADS), translating to a payout of nearly a quarter of the ticker&rsquo;s $4.46 close the day before the announcement. Such dividends have become relatively common among U.S.-listed Chinese companies lately, as they try to lure back investors who once were attracted simply by the China growth story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s shares jumped some 14% following the earnings release, though they later gave back all the gains and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huya loses money on an operating basis, so it could clearly benefit from any gains in profitability. In the second quarter, it recorded an operating loss of 26 million yuan, although that&rsquo;s about 20% smaller than the year-earlier period, the result of reductions in all operating expense items, including R&amp;D and marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also earns relatively significant interest income from bank deposits and wealth management products, allowing it to stay in the black in the second quarter. Its finances are in pretty good shape, with its cash and cash equivalents nearly doubling to 1 billion yuan at the end of June from six months earlier, which explains why it can be so generous with returning money to shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huya&rsquo;s financial profile is similar to that of rival&nbsp;<strong>DouYu</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DOYU#NASDAQ\">DOYU</a>). The two, which previously sought to merge in 2020 but were prevented by a regulatory veto, generate similar amounts of revenue and operate on poor margins that result in shaky profitability. DouYu also benefits from interest income, although it wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep the company in the black in the first quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the pair experienced abrupt losses of their CEOs last year, though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebambooworks.com/misfortune-for-douyu-as-ceo-faces-gambling-charges/\">DouYu&rsquo;s case</a>&nbsp;seemed more serious. Last November, DouYu said that its founder and CEO Chen Shaojie, who had gone missing for weeks, was arrested, with Chengu police saying he was charged with opening a gambling business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors are a bit more optimistic about Huya between the two. Its shares now trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.2, which is hardly spectacular but outshines the 0.9 for DouYu. The graver leadership troubles for DouYu may be a factor behind the valuation gap, but investors may also be giving Huya credit for its early success in diversifying its services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, the company will need to show it can continue to beef up its new business, while still at least maintaining revenue from its main streaming services. Some higher margins would also help, showing that Huya can not only return to revenue growth, but can also start to generate profits at levels more befitting a tech company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

According to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/?gspk=YWRhbWVja2VydDUzMzY&amp;gsxid=zBMR4PKmcgBw\">Benzinga Pro</a>, investors traded more than 99 million shares in Thursday's session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40491921/whats-going-on-with-trump-media-technology-stock\"><strong>What&#8217;s Going On With Trump Media &amp; Technology Stock?</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, the company also announced a launch event for its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/08/b40437825/faraday-future-announces-launch-event-date-for-china-u-s-automotive-bridge-strategy\">China-U.S. Automotive Bridge Strategy</a>.

Powell hinted that policy would likely need to stay restrictive &#8220;for some time&#8221; to bring inflation down. He suggested that another 75 basis point hike &#8220;could be appropriate.&#8221; This caused a spike in Treasury yields and a downturn in equities. The S&amp;P 500, tracked by SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>), dropped over 3% as <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/08/40446287/investors-look-for-clues-on-september-rate-cut-at-jackson-hole-how-does-stock-mar\">this Benzinga analysis shows</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around, market-moving reactions are less likely to stem from whether a rate cut will occur at the September Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC). That scenario is already fully priced in by market participants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What matters more is the size of that cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculators favor a 25 basis point cut, assigning it a 75% probability, according to the <strong>CME Group</strong>&#8216;s FedWatch tool as of Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40511947/investors-are-further-confused-on-snowflake-one-analyst-says-they-know-why\">Snowflake Investors &#8216;Further Confused&#8217; After Q2 Earnings And One Analyst Knows Why</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Do Analysts Expect From Powell&#8217;s Speech? </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We expect Powell to express a bit more confidence in the inflation outlook and to put a bit more emphasis on downside risks in the labor market than in his press conference after the July FOMC meeting, in light of the data released since then,&#8221; said Goldman Sachs economist <strong>David Mericle.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that such comments would likely reinforce market expectations of a rate cut in September while deferring the 25bp versus 50bp question to the August employment report. Goldman Sachs is forecasting a series of three consecutive 25bp cuts in September, November, and December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dovish surprise could be any hint that the funds rate level is inappropriately high, while a hawkish surprise might come from highlighting that broad financial conditions remain relatively loose, according to Mericle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Elevated expectations of 100-125bps cuts in the federal funds rate over the coming six months have helped sink the entire Treasury yield curve,&#8221; said <strong>Ed Yardeni</strong>, president of Yardeni Research. He expects Fed officials to push back against these expectations if the next batch of economic indicators exceeds projections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank of America anticipates Powell may lean toward modifying the July FOMC language to suggest the committee is &#8220;very close&#8221; or &#8220;close&#8221; to initiating easing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A further signal could be Powell&#8217;s stronger emphasis on avoiding &#8220;unexpected weakness&#8221; in the labor market, rather than simply responding after it occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The risk is more hawkish Fed communications. If Powell does not signal a rate cut at the September FOMC meeting or suggests that large-scale rate reductions are off the table, we would expect a meaningful bear or twist flattening of the UST curve,&#8221; wrote Bank of America rates strategist <strong>Mark Cabana</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toronto Dominon expects Powell to signal that the Fed is ready to begin its anticipated easing cycle at the September FOMC meeting. Recent favorable data, particularly on inflation, should support Powell in signaling readiness to ease. However, they remain skeptical that Powell will fully commit to the size of the rate reduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&#x1f534;WATCH LIVE: FED Chair Jerome Powell Economic Outlook Speech, Jackson Hole 2024\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qwlus-xX7bc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/08/40506223/initial-jobless-claims-rise-more-than-expected-indicating-slowdown-in-labor-marke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Initial Jobless Claims Rise More Than Expected, Indicating Slowdown In Labor Market Conditions</a></strong></li>\n</ul>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T17:09:28Z", "headline": "Could Powell's Jackson Hole Speech Keep The Door Open For 50-Basis-Point Rate Cut?", "id": 40513380, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/powell-jackson-hole-fed.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/powell-jackson-hole-fed.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/powell-jackson-hole-fed.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Market awaits Fed Chair Powell&#39;s speech at Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday, expecting clues on short-term monetary policy guidance and potential rate cuts.", "symbols": ["SPY"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T17:09:29Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/08/40513380/could-powells-jackson-hole-speech-keep-the-door-open-for-50-basis-point-rate-cut"}

Designed for gamers with limited mobility, it offers an alternative to the standard Xbox controller while maintaining a similar price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ByoWave Proteus Controller, also available now, provides a high level of customization, with over &#8220;100 million different combinations&#8221; possible.

For instance, the packaging for the Xbox Adaptive Joystick features a center-seamed shipping design, looped tape, a large base-tab for easier handling, a hinged box lid, and the elimination of twist ties. These design elements have been applied to the packaging of the new Xbox Series X/S console options as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At Xbox, we are committed to empowering everyone to play the games they want, with the people they want, anywhere they want, in a way that works for them,&#8221; the company said in an Xbox Wire Post.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introducing the Xbox Adaptive Joystick\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkXO8MeX7vA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/23/07/33235375/sony-breaks-new-ground-in-gaming-accessibility-playstation-access-controller-preorders-set-to-begi\">Sony Breaks New Ground In Gaming Accessibility: PlayStation Access Controller Preorders Set To Begin</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Xbox.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T17:40:37Z", "headline": "Xbox Introduces Four New Accessibility Devices, Features For Disabled Gamers", "id": 40514006, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/16x9-SingleHand-Clean-84244be0b7111e8b31.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/16x9-SingleHand-Clean-84244be0b7111e8b31.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/16x9-SingleHand-Clean-84244be0b7111e8b31.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Xbox announces new accessibility devices and features, including the Adaptive Joystick and Toggle Hold.", "symbols": ["MSFT"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T17:40:37Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/24/08/40514006/xbox-introduces-four-new-accessibility-devices-features-for-disabled-gamers"}

Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 2.19 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Wells Fargo Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1724349613_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Wells Fargo has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing Wells Fargo's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Wells Fargo's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 0.97%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T18:00:16Z", "headline": "(WFC) - Analyzing Wells Fargo's Short Interest", "id": 40514257, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["WFC"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T18:00:17Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/short-sellers/24/08/40514257/wfc-analyzing-wells-fargos-short-interest"}

These are the sort of like first shots you get.\" He suggested Solana ETFs might have better prospects under a different political administration or with the development of futures markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29155259/905735A6-57D3-4874-9AA1-75D037842DB3-2.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-270548\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40470226/solana-etf-approval-in-2024-has-only-a-6-chance-a-snowballs-chance-in-hell-etf-analyst-say\">Solana ETF Approval In 2024 Has Only A 6% Chance: &#8216;A Snowball&#8217;s Chance In Hell,&#8217; ETF Analyst Says</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The analysts suggested patience with Ethereum ETFs, expecting a slower adoption curve compared to Bitcoin ETFs. Balchunas explained, \"I always equate the Ether to silver to gold. They&#8217;ll have their own little market.\" He added, &#8220;It&#8217;s a long game. They&#8217;re off to a decent start.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touched on the broader ETF market, highlighting record inflows across various sectors. Balchunas noted, &#8220;The breadth of flows beyond equities is a really promising sign for the industry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A particularly interesting development was the launch of highly volatile products like leveraged <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40399008/mstx-becomes-first-single-stock-leveraged-etf-for-microstrategy-stock-offers-175-exposure\">MicroStrategy ETFs</a> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSTX#NASDAQ\">MSTX</a>).

Here&#8217;s a look at <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com//node/40442659\">what&#8217;s going on</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Details:</strong> CAVA is anticipated to release earnings for the 2024 fiscal year second quarter on Thursday after the market closes. Analysts expect EPS of $0.12 and revenue of $218.21 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAVA has a solid record of beating analysts estimate for EPS and revenue, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro</a>. For the first quarter, CAVA reported EPS of $0.12 beating analysts estimate of $0.04. Also, CAVA reported revenue of $259 million beating analysts estimate of $245.93 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Analyst Change:</strong> Earlier this week, Stifel analyst <strong>Chris O&#8217;Cull </strong>maintained a Buy rating on Cava Group and raised the price target from&nbsp;$90&nbsp;to&nbsp;$110.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock is currently trading above its 52 week high of $102.9 at about $104. In addition, its trading above its 50 moving average of $88.86.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How To Buy CAVA Group Shares</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share &#8211; or fractional share &#8211; of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Cava Group (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CAVA#NYSE\">CAVA</a>)'s case, it is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/08/40511132/chick-fil-a-launching-streaming-app-will-it-be-available-on-sundays\">Chick-fil-A Plans Streaming App: Will It Be Available On Sundays?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CAVA Price Action:</strong> At the time of writing, CAVA stock is trading 1.58% higher at $104.46 per data from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Courtesy of CAVA</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T18:22:24Z", "headline": "What's Going On With CAVA Stock Thursday?", "id": 40514671, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/bbb85js8kwgr7vq4qx77xpc.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/bbb85js8kwgr7vq4qx77xpc.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/bbb85js8kwgr7vq4qx77xpc.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "CAVA is anticipated to release earnings on Thursday after the market closes.", "symbols": ["CAVA"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T18:22:24Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40514671/whats-going-on-with-cava-stock-thursday"}

It was gifted to British King Edward VII in 1907 and cut into several smaller gems that are now either part of the country's Crown Jewels or owned by the royal family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bigger pure diamonds have been found, including \"Sergio\", which was 3167 carats but was not gem-quality, rather what is referred to as a black diamond.

These figures show a revival in consumer engagement, likely driven by highly anticipated releases and the promise of new hardware on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the top drivers of this upswing is <strong>Electronic Arts Inc</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EA#NASDAQ\">EA</a>) EA Sports College Football 25, which Circana identified as the best-selling game of the year, so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the industry's overall outlook for 2024 remains cautious. <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong>, video game industry advisor at Circana, pointed out: \"This will continue to be a difficult year for video game manufacturers and publishers, as an overall spending decline, albeit in the low single-digits, is expected.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A New Gaming Era: 2025 and Beyond</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Circana's Future of Video Games Report paints a more optimistic picture for 2025, predicting a significant rebound. This positive forecast hinges on the launch of <strong>Nintendo ADR</strong>'s (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NTDOY#OTC\">NTDOY</a>) next-generation hardware platform and the highly anticipated release of <strong>Take-Two Interactive Software Inc</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TTWO#NASDAQ\">TTWO</a>) <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong>, which Piscatella believes could become \"the biggest entertainment launch in U.S. history.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital delivery continues to be a strong trend, with Circana projecting ongoing dominance in this area. The report notes that &#8220;forever&#8221; games like Fortnite and Roblox will continue to capture significant player time, potentially reshaping how new titles compete for attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hardware Declines Offset By Emerging Trends</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>While video game hardware revenue is expected to decline this year due to lower average prices and fewer units sold, Circana highlights an interesting shift. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More players are turning to easily accessible platforms such as PCs and mobile devices, helping to cushion the blow to traditional console sales. The report explicitly mentions Valve's Steam Deck as an &#8220;emerging and exciting area of video game hardware.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The transition to the new normal in the video game market has not been painless,&#8221; Piscatella added.

Anmuth also believes Chewy&#8217;s current full-year outlook could prove to be conservative against improving industry trends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan has a December 2024 price target of $28 on Chewy shares based on 18.5 times 2025 adjusted EBITDA. This represents a premium to other online retail competitors trading at around 16 times on average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We believe a premium vs peers is warranted now (vs. a slight discount previously) due to improving results with green shoots around industry trends and better execution,&#8221; Anmuth said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CHWY Price Action:</strong> Chewy shares were down 2.69% at $26.37 at the time of publication, according to <a href=\"http://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/pexels-2286921/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1851106\">Pexels</a> from Pixabay.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/social-media/24/08/40225079/roaring-kitty-loses-thousands-of-x-followers-after-going-silent-on-gamestop-chewy\"><strong>Roaring Kitty Loses Thousands Of X Followers After Going Silent On GameStop, Chewy</strong></a></li>\n</ul>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T18:43:02Z", "headline": "Chewy Analyst Highlights Website Visits Growth, 'Green Shoots' Across Industry Ahead Of Q2 Earnings", "id": 40514989, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/black-dog-1851106-1920.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/black-dog-1851106-1920.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/black-dog-1851106-1920.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Chewy is due to report second-quarter financial results before the market opens on Aug. 28.

{"author": "Murtuza Merchant", "content": "<p>Former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has once again made headlines, this time with a bold foray into the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40510678/bitcoins-performance-is-tied-to-donald-trumps-election-prospects-asset-manager-states\">world of cryptocurrency</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Trump on Thursday announced the upcoming launch of a new crypto platform named &#8220;The DeFiant Ones&#8221; to his 7.5 million followers on Truth Social, marking a significant shift in his stance on digital currencies, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/trump-crypto-defi-protocol-launch.html\">reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,&#8221; Trump declared in his post. &#8220;It&#8217;s time we take a stand \u2014 together.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This announcement is particularly noteworthy as it is the first time Trump has used his personal platform to promote this yet-to-be-activated digital banking initiative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the post, his son, <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong>, echoed the sentiment by sharing the news with his 12 million followers on <strong>X</strong>, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post also included a link to a Telegram channel named &#8220;The DeFiant Ones,&#8221; which had garnered around 29,000 followers as of Thursday morning, with numbers rapidly increasing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An earlier post on Aug. 15 described the channel as the &#8220;only official Telegram channel for the Trump DeFi project,&#8221; positioning it as a leader in &#8220;building the future of finance.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Trump</strong> and Donald Trump Jr. have been hinting at this project for weeks. Eric Trump recently described the forthcoming platform as &#8220;digital real estate&#8221; in an interview with <strong>The New York Post</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s equitable. It&#8217;s collateral anyone can get access to and do so instantly,&#8221; Eric explained. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if people realize what a shake up that is for the world of banking and finance. I hope we can help change that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump brothers have also emphasized the transformative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi), urging their followers to &#8220;stay tuned for a big announcement.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &#8220;digital real estate&#8221; may suggest the project&#8217;s involvement in selling tokenized versions of real-world assets or virtual properties within the metaverse, a concept that gained significant attention during the last crypto bull market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40509983/will-rfk-jr-endorse-donald-trump-on-friday-86-chance-crypto-bettors-say-but-landing-a-cabi\">Will RFK Jr. Endorse Donald Trump On Friday? 86% Chance, Crypto Bettors Say, But Landing A Cabinet Position Looks Less Likely</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The timing of this announcement is crucial, coming as Trump intensifies his campaign efforts against Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> in the upcoming presidential election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president's pivot to crypto aligns with his efforts to rejuvenate his campaign and appeal to a broader base, particularly within the tech-savvy, pro-crypto community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an Aug. 8 interview on Locals, Donald Trump Jr. clarified that their venture is not about launching a meme coin but rather about creating a platform that could challenge the traditional banking system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we want to do is take on a lot of the banking world,&#8221; he said, emphasizing the need for financial equality. &#8220;I think there has been a lot of inequality in that only certain people can get financing [&#8230;] so this notion of decentralized finance is obviously very appealing to guys like me who have been debanked.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Sr.&#8217;s recent moves in the crypto space signal a significant departure from his previous skepticism about digital currencies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, he launched a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40445918/how-much-has-donald-trump-made-from-nft-sales-its-more-than-you-might-think\">non-fungible token (NFT) collection</a> on the Solana blockchain and became the first major presidential nominee to accept cryptocurrency donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His involvement in the crypto community has since grown, with the former president headlining major Bitcoin events and revealing in a financial disclosure form that he owns over $1 million in cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These developments underscore Trump&#8217;s evolving image as a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40170207/harris-vs-trump-on-crypto-experts-question-each-candidates-take-on-bitcoin\">pro-crypto candidate</a>, a sharp contrast to his previous stance during his presidency when he famously referred to <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) as <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/06/21456522/former-us-president-donald-trump-thinks-bitcoin-is-a-scam\">a &#8220;scam.&#8221;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Trump positions himself as a champion of decentralized finance, the endorsements and donations from the crypto sector have surged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of July, he reported raising <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/39014553/trump-embraces-crypto-donations-could-it-alter-digital-asset-playing-field\">$25 million</a> from crypto-related sources, highlighting the growing influence of digital currencies in the political landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This intersection of politics and cryptocurrency will be a key focus at the upcoming Benzinga <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\">Future of Digital Assets</a> event on Nov. 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/08/40506735/tether-now-holds-81b-in-treasury-bills-aims-for-further-growth\">Tether Now Holds $81B In Treasury Bills, Aims For Further Growth</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ", "created_at": "2024-08-22T18:44:22Z", "headline": "Donald Trump Launches Crypto Platform 'The DeFiant Ones' To Challenge Traditional Banking Systems", "id": 40515026, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Why-It-Matters.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Why-It-Matters.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/Why-It-Matters.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has once again made headlines, this time with a bold foray into the world of cryptocurrency.", "symbols": ["BTCUSD"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T18:44:23Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40515026/donald-trump-launches-crypto-platform-the-defiant-ones-to-challenge-traditional-banking-sy"}

Eaton has since become an industrial powerhouse largely through acquisitions in various end markets. Eaton's portfolio can broadly be divided into two parts: its electrical and industrial businesses. Its electrical portfolio (representing around 70% of company revenue) sells components within data centers, utilities, and commercial and residential buildings, while its industrial business (30% of revenue) sells components within commercial and passenger vehicles and aircraft. Eaton receives favorable tax treatment as a domiciliary of Ireland, but it generates over half of its revenue within the US.</p>\n<p>After a thorough review of the options trading surrounding Eaton Corp, we move to examine the company in more detail.

It was dead money for years.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woods said the sum of the parts was greater than the whole for GE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defense sector could continue to benefit from geopolitical concerns and a lot of bad things happening in the world, Woods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I think you&#8217;ve got to watch this sector closely.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/broad-u-s-equity-etfs/24/07/40025773/bad-news-ahead-for-investors-august-september-are-worst-two-months-over-past-20-years-\">Bad News Ahead For Investors?

Woods noted that while the stock has been hit hard on earnings in the past, it&#8217;s poised for a comeback in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woods mentioned that naming Cisco often catches people off guard, given the stock has done nothing over the last 20 years. However, in the short term, Woods said that the stock appears to have broken out of a downtrend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An acquisition of Splunk is still being digested by Cisco, but could help in its cybersecurity efforts, Woods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I think they're starting to reap the benefits of that. Cisco to me looks like something's changed. It's worth taking a flyer.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woods said Cisco isn't a popular recommendation, but there could be something there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"If you like boring, I give you Cisco.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market strategist said picking individual stocks could outperform the overall cybersecurity sector, but the CrowdStrike drop also shows the impact one bad stock can have on a portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I think the safest way to play cyber is the ETFs.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Investing In Defense Stocks: ETFs or Individual Names?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTM2J1dfM6M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch the full PreMarketPrep episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXosi2hWTQ\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/exclusives/24/07/39886192/exclusive-tesla-an-elon-musk-and-a-technology-story-first-ev-story-last-market-strategist-explains-w\">EXCLUSIVE: Tesla &#8216;An Elon Musk And A Technology Story First, EV Story Last&#8217; \u2014 Market Strategist Explains Why To Buy The Stock</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo created with images from Benzinga and artificial intelligence using Midjourney.</p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T19:13:39Z", "headline": "EXCLUSIVE: Trump Or Harris? 12 Stocks, 2 ETFs Could Win No Matter Who's President, Says Market Strategist", "id": 40515453, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/jay-woods-nyse.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/jay-woods-nyse.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2024/08/22/jay-woods-nyse.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": "Market strategist Jay Woods shares 12 stocks and 2 ETFs to watch from two sectors that look strong ahead of the 2024 election.", "symbols": ["BA", "CHKP", "CRWD", "CSCO", "FTNT", "GD", "GE", "HACK", "ITA", "LMT", "NET", "NOC", "PANW", "RTX"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T19:13:39Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/sector-etfs/24/08/40515453/exclusive-trump-or-harris-12-stocks-2-etfs-could-win-no-matter-whos-president-says-market-strate"}

Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Virginia Ntl Bankshares Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1724354119_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Virginia Ntl Bankshares has declined since its last report.

Leading the charge are companies like <strong>Zealand Pharma A/S </strong>(OTCPK:ZLDPF) (0.32% of assets) and <strong>Marks and Spencer Group plc</strong> (OTCQX:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MAKSF#OTCQX\">MAKSF</a>) (0.31% of assets), both of which have seen positive developments recently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These companies, along with others like <strong>DS Smith Plc </strong>(OTCPK:DITHF) and <strong>Addtech AB</strong> (OTCPK:ADDHY), are helping to drive SCZ&#8217;s robust performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As interest in small-cap stocks continues to grow, investors may want to keep an eye on events like the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/small-cap/global-small-cap-conference-2024/\">Benzinga SmallCAP Conference</a>, where industry trends and investment opportunities in this space are often highlighted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/24/08/40447799/small-caps-soar-3-russell-2000-stocks-doubling-investor-wealth-in-2024\">Small Caps Soar: 3 Russell 2000 Stocks Doubling Investor Wealth In 2024</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Regional &amp; Sector Strength</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Europe (50.81%) and Asia Pacific (48.5%) dominate the ETF&#8217;s regional exposure, with Japan (34.94%), the United Kingdom (14.59%), and Australia (9.28%) as the top three countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This geographic diversification is proving advantageous as these regions continue to recover and grow in the post-pandemic economic landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the fund trading at a high, investors might wonder if there's more room to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical charts indicate that the iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, with its share price currently above its five, 20 and 50-day exponential moving averages. The ETF has consistently stayed above key moving averages, including the eight-day simple moving average (SMA) at $63.79, the 20-day SMA at $62.91 and the 50-day SMA at $62.82, all signaling bullish momentum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 200-day SMA at $61.56, the ETF's current price further confirms the ongoing upward trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given its strong holdings and bullish trends in key regions, SCZ might continue to perform well.

The accident, which occurred on August 19, resulted in the vehicle's battery catching fire and caused a significant traffic disruption. As Tesla prepares to ramp up production of the Semi by the end of 2025, this incident raises concerns about the safety and reliability of its new vehicle models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Tesla has delayed the rollout of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology for the Cybertruck. Initially expected to be available in late June, the FSD feature is now scheduled for release in September. CEO <strong>Elon Musk </strong>has previously provided multiple timelines for the FSD rollout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Else: </strong>Over the past month, traders have targeted a price range between $210.00 and $230.00 for Tesla.

Dogs are the most popular, with 65.1 million households featuring a &#8220;good boy.&#8221; 46.5 million households own cats and 11.1 million own freshwater fish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lends credence to the fact that <strong>Dogecoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/doge/usd\">DOGE</a>) and <strong>Shiba Inu</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/shib/usd\">SHIB</a>) are the most prominent meme coins, both of which are dog-themed (or, to be more precise, Shiba Inu-themed).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Coinweb <a href=\"https://coinweb.com/trends/how-many-americans-own-crypto/\">research</a>, 48.8 million U.S. adults own cryptocurrencies, representing 14.36% of the adult population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means more households own a dog than adults own cryptocurrencies. But what about individual dog owners compared to crypto owners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statista data <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/\">shows</a> that the average American household consisted of 2.51 people in 2023. 65.1 million households with dogs divided by 2.51 people per household yields 25.93 million household members owning a dog. Ignoring the fact that minors may be owning a dog, this is still far behind the 48.8 million adults owning crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>48.8 million U.S. adults own crypto also outnumbers the 46.5 million households owning cats. Does that explain why cat-themed coins like <strong>Popcat</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">POPCAT</a>), <strong>cat in a dogs world</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">MEW</a>) and <strong>Mog Coin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">MOG</a>) are less popular than dog coins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correlation may not be causation, but it is telling that there is no fish-themed meme coin on the market, considering only 11.1 million households own fish as pets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over 6 million <a href=\"https://u.today/dogecoin-doge-surpasses-6-million-addresses-amid-bullish-momentum\">unique Dogecoin addresses</a> and 1.4 million unique <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce\">SHIB holders</a>, dogs are flexing their teeth in the crypto world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> According to Benzinga&#8217;s not-so-scientific research, Matt Hougan&#8217;s (alleged) claim that more Americans hold crypto than dogs is <strong>correct</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40320994/whats-going-on-with-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-this-week\">What&#8217;s Going On With Dogecoin And Shiba Inu This Week?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.</em></p>    ", "created_at": "2024-08-22T20:02:03Z", "headline": "Bitcoin Beating Good Boys: Do Really More Americans Own Crypto Than Dogs?

Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Coca-Cola Consolidated Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1724357722_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Coca-Cola Consolidated has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing Coca-Cola Consolidated's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Coca-Cola Consolidated's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 7.32%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "created_at": "2024-08-22T20:15:25Z", "headline": "Peering Into Coca-Cola Consolidated's Recent Short Interest", "id": 40516594, "images": [{"size": "large", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}, {"size": "small", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}, {"size": "thumb", "url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg"}], "source": "benzinga", "summary": " ", "symbols": ["COKE"], "updated_at": "2024-08-22T20:15:25Z", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/short-sellers/24/08/40516594/peering-into-coca-cola-consolidateds-recent-short-interest"}

{"author": "Piero Cingari", "content": "<p>Members of the Federal Reserve are hinting at a potential shift towards lowering interest rates, with Boston Fed President <strong>Susan Collins</strong> and Philadelphia Fed President <strong>Patrick Harker</strong> both indicating that the central bank might begin easing rates <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/24/08/40492530/fed-minutes-reveal-plausible-case-for-interest-rate-cut-as-policymakers-cheer-inflation-progress\">as soon as September. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their comments came just before Federal Reserve Chairman<strong> Jerome Powell</strong>'s highly anticipated speech at <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/08/40513380/could-powells-jackson-hole-speech-keep-the-door-open-for-50-basis-point-rate-cut\">the Jackson Hole Symposium.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins expressed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/262929cf-dd93-4171-aeea-941cbcc24e0b\">to</a> the Financial Times on Thursday confidence in the U.S. economy. Inflation has receded, she said, and the labor market has cooled without raising significant concerns. She indicated that with inflation on track to meet the Fed&#8217;s 2% target, it may be time to adjust the benchmark federal funds rate, currently at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The timing seems appropriate to begin easing monetary policy. There is a clear path to achieving the Fed&#8217;s goals without an unneeded downturn,&#8221; the official stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She mentioned that a gradual and methodical pace in easing would be most suitable once the Fed changes its policy stance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harker: Methodical Rate Cuts Needed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Harker echoed Collins&#8217; sentiment in an interview with Market News on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He argued that the Fed should start lowering interest rates in September in a methodical manner, allowing businesses to plan accordingly. With the U.S. labor market stabilizing and inflation cooling, Harker believes it&#8217;s time to begin the process of normalizing rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harker stressed the importance of not overreacting to single data points, such as the unexpected rise in the unemployment rate to 4.3% in July. He expects the jobless rate to peak below 5%, near its natural rate of around 4.5%, while labor force participation has improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On inflation, Harker expressed confidence that the Fed won't face persistent inflation above the 2% target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When we start to normalize rates, we&#8217;ll see the shelter inflation issue resolve itself over time as capacity comes online. I just don&#8217;t see the dynamics in the economy right now leading to a point where we get stuck significantly above 2%,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harker emphasized that the key to maintaining business confidence is a well-orchestrated series of rate cuts to bring them back to a neutral level, which he estimates to be around 3%. He highlighted the importance of a predictable process, suggesting that a gradual reduction in rates would be more beneficial than abrupt changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the destination for interest rates remains uncertain, but Harker speculated that they could settle around 3%, driven by real data from the market, inflation trends, and labor market conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Reactions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. dollar index held session during afternoon trading in New York, up by 0.4% at 3:30 p.m. ET.

This leaves a third model with minimal details publicly shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenkins said in the interview that he is a fan of wagons, but called it a \"dying segment,\" making it unlikely that a station wagon is coming from Lucid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's more likely that the new vehicle will have off-road capabilities, positioning it to compete with the likes of Tesla and <strong>Rivian Automotive</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The off-road space is going to continue to morph and evolve,\" Jenkins said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lucid design executive said an off-road vehicle could provide Lucid with the best of \"two worlds.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/08/40171836/lucid-q2-earnings-highlights-revenue-beat-eps-miss-1-5-billion-financing-commitment-from-saudi-inve\">Lucid Q2 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Miss, $1.5-Billion Financing Commitment From Saudi Investment Fund</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong> Lucid recently reported second-quarter financials and got a new cash injection that could help provide cushion for the next few years of vehicle releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of the Lucid Air has decreased on newer versions, which could boost customer demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of the Gravity SUV serves as a real test for Lucid as it expands into a new category and competes with several market leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucid CEO <strong>Peter Rawlinson, </strong>who previously worked at Tesla, has not shied away from directly competing with the company led by <strong>Elon Musk.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rawlinson previously said Lucid will develop electric vehicles in the $50,000 price range that is \"right in the heart of Tesla Model 3, Model Y territory.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LCID Price Action</strong>: Lucid shares are up 7% to $3.84 on Thursday, versus a 52-week trading range of $2.29 to $6.45.
